/(The following proceedings were held in open court, out of the presence
of the jury:)/

//*THE COURT:* Good morning, counsel. Back on the record in the Simpson
matter. The Defendant is again present with his counsel, Mr. Cochran,
Mr. Scheck, Mr. Blasier, People represented by Mr. Harmon and Mr.
Darden. The jury is not present. Counsel, is there anything we need to
take up before we invite the jurors to rejoin us? Mr. Blasier.

*MR. BLASIER:* Very briefly, your Honor. With Miss Montgomery, the final
product in the D1S80 test is an x-ray, and we were not provided with
copies of those x-rays. What we have is our photographs. So when Mr.
Harmon is done with his direct, I would like a little bit of time so
that Miss Montgomery can review our photographs to assure herself that
they're the same.

*THE COURT:* All right. And how long do you think that will take?

*MR. BLASIER:* I don't think too long. There are only about six or seven
of them that I'm going to refer to.

*THE COURT:* Okay. All right. Deputy Magnera, let's have the jurors, please.

/(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury:)/

//*THE COURT:* Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Please be seated. Let
the record reflect we've now been rejoined by all the members of our
jury panel. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

*THE JURY: *Good morning.

*THE COURT:* All right. Good morning, Mr. Harmon.

*MR. HARMON:* Good morning, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* Ladies and gentlemen, as you recollect, we took a break in
the redirect examination of Gary Sims so he could attend to some family
business up north; and the Prosecution will take another witness out of
order so that we can proceed in an orderly manner with the trial. Mr.
Harmon, do you have another witness available?

*MR. HARMON:* Yes, I do. Renee Montgomery, your Honor.

_D*IRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. HARMON*_

__*MR. HARMON:* Miss Montgomery, who do you work for?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I work for the State of California, Department of
Justice at the Modesto or excuse me--I'm sorry--at the Berkeley DNA
laboratory.

*MR. HARMON:* And how long have you worked there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Over two and a half years.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. What is your present assignment there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* My present assignment is casework analysis and also
lead analyst in the development of new methods such as STR's for use in
casework.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. We'll talk about that in a little bit after we
discuss your education and background that have contributed to being in
the position you're in, okay?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay.

*MR. HARMON:* Where did you--do you have a college degree?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I do. I have a bachelor of science in
environmental toxicology from the University of California at Davis. I
graduated in June of 1988.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And can you describe just generally the field of
environmental toxicology and whatever scientific courses you took to
achieve that degree?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Sure. Environmental toxicology is the study of
toxicants in the environment and how they react with the body and also
how they react in the environment. This course work included extensive
instrumental analysis and also courses in chemistry and biology and anatomy.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And after you got your degree, what was your first
employment?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I began work in--at the end of the summer in 1988 at
the Modesto criminalistics laboratory.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And we'll talk about that in a bit, but let's focus
on courses you've taken which have contributed to the position that
you're in right now. Did you take any courses in pursuit of your
undergraduate degree that relate in any way to forensic DNA typing that
you've performed for the DOJ lab?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. After graduation, I began taking courses in
extending my education, and the majority of my course work, well, the
ones that are relevant to DNA analysis, began in 1992. And the first
course was a genetics course through California State University at
Hayward, and this was a one-quarter unit in--with--under the topic of
genetics. I then took a--

*MR. HARMON:* Could we just--give us a little description, if you would,
of the course and how it might relate to the testimony that I'm going to
be eliciting from you.

*MR. BLASIER:* Your Honor, I'm going to object. I think the question was
about undergraduate courses, and I think she's talking about after
graduation.

*THE COURT:* Why don't you rephrase the question.

*MR. HARMON:* Sure.

*MR. HARMON:* Have we moved from undergraduate to graduate courses?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* We moved from undergraduate to post-graduation courses.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. So the genetics course that you took is a graduate
course?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. That's a post-graduation course.

*MR. HARMON:* A post-graduation course?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Exactly. After I graduated from college, it's a course
that I took after I had already obtained a degree, bachelor of science.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Could you briefly describe that course?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. It was the study of genetics, the study--part of
the course involved DNA and how DNA functioned in the body and also
molecular biology.

*MR. HARMON:* Was there actually any hands-on work in that course?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. HARMON:* What was the next course that you took that contributes to
the area of expertise that I'll be asking you to testify about?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* The next course I took was a two-semester course in
molecular biology, and this was through the University of California at
Berkeley and their extension program, and this began in winter semester
of 1992 and it continued through I believe it was May of 1993; and it
was a two-semester course and it involved molecular biology going into
DNA, RNA and the function of it in the body.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Was any of that work hands-on work?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. HARMON:* What was the next course--or strike that. You say it was a
two-semester course?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* How many credits or how many hours did you actually go to
class every week?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I believe it was two--two nights a week for three
hours, and it was four units per semester. So a total of eight units.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And what was the next course then?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* The next course, I was sent to the FBI academy in
Quantico, Virginia for a four-week course in forensic DNA technology
both in classroom training and laboratory training; and this was a
six-unit graduate level course. That's it.

*MR. HARMON:* When was that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That was in the month of June, 1993.

*MR. HARMON:* And would you describe the kind of work that that course
consisted of?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. That focused on DNA analysis as it pertained to
forensic--forensic analysis.

*MR. HARMON:* Could you please expand on that a little bit more?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Sure. We went into both RFLP and PCR techniques, and
it was both the practical application and also the theoretical
application behind RFLP and PCR. We did in-lab practice testing of
samples and also some unknown samples by both RFLP and the PCR methods.

*MR. HARMON:* And how many hours a day did that course consist of?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That was in excess of eight hours per day.

*MR. HARMON:* Over how long a period of time?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Four weeks, but not Saturday and Sunday.

*MR. HARMON:* And how many credits was that course good for?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It was six units of graduate level through the
University of Virginia.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And what was the next course that you took that
contributed to your expertise in forensic DNA typing?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* The next course was in the fall of 1993, and this was
a course, statistics for biologists, and it was a one-semester course
through UC Berkeley extension.

*MR. HARMON:* Can you describe what that course consisted of?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That course was on the basics of statistics and
particularly how it related to scientific research, developing studies
to be used in both a clinical environment and pharmaceutical environments.

*MR. HARMON:* And how does that relate to the area of forensic DNA typing?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, it helped me understand more--understand the
papers, the literature on statistics and how statistics are used for DNA
analysis.

*MR. HARMON:* And then what was the next course that you took, the next
additional course that you took?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* The next course--I'll need to refer to my CV.

*MR. HARMON:* Sure.

*THE COURT:* Mr. Blasier, do you have a copy of that?

*MR. BLASIER:* I do not.

*THE COURT:* Mr. Harmon, do you have a copy you can show to Mr. Blasier?

*MR. HARMON:* Sure.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*THE COURT:* Do you have any extra copies of that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*THE COURT:* All right. Mr. Blasier, why don't you approach the witness
and get an extra copy.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* This is actually a copy that was discovered by the
Defense.

*THE COURT:* All right. Mr. Harmon.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Have you had a chance to look at it or do you need--

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I have. And the next course, it's not on Mr.
Blasier's copy, it was a DNA sequencing course through the University of
Northern Colorado in Greeley, and that was in the summer of 1994.

*MR. HARMON:* What did that consist of?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It was DNA sequencing. It went through both the PCR
extraction techniques and also sequencing of DNA.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. In addition to those courses that you've described,
is there something called the California criminalistics institute?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Have you taken courses through them which relate to any
areas of expertise in the field of criminalistics?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I have.

*MR. HARMON:* Could you describe what or tell us what those courses are,
just briefly describe them?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay. As the courses that pertain to DNA analysis,
what were a one-week course through the California criminalistics
institute and it was all on PCR analysis. And this course was--it was
one week, eight hours a day, and it was taught by some of the more
prominent members of the forensic community such as Dr. Edward Blake,
Dr. Becky Reynolds and Dr. George Sensabaugh. And this course was both a
practical, meaning we did laboratory work, and also a theoretical course.

*MR. HARMON:* And how many hours did that course consist of?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It was a 40-hour course.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Over how long a period of time?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* One week.

*MR. HARMON:* One week? And what was the next course that you took
through the California criminalistics institute?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, that was the most recent course that I took.
Prior to that, I took extensive courses in the area of general
criminalistics, and I'll need to refer to a sheet. The list is quite
long. And these ranged from techniques for conventional serology such as
basic microscopy, and this was a one-week course in the use of the
microscope as it pertains to forensic work, and also zone
electrophoresis which is a technique used for genetic markers such as
enzymes. I also took a sexual assault evidence course, and this was a
course that was devoted to extraction techniques for sexual assault
cases, examining evidence that pertains to sexual assault cases and also
the analysis of evidence for sexual assault cases. Would you like me to
continue on this list?

*MR. HARMON:* Would you, please. Sure.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay. I took a course on analysis of low explosives,
and that was in April of 1992. That was just prior to transferring to
the DNA laboratory, and that was a course taught by ATF, Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, and that was through the California criminalistics
institute also, and a course in analysis of clan lab evidence. And this
is analysis of samples for clandestine laboratory, meaning drug
laboratories where individuals are making PCP or methamphetamine or some
other type of illegal drug. I took an arson accelerant course in 1991,
and that was the--also, there was some individuals from ATF, alcohol,
tobacco and firearms at that course, and that was on analyzing samples
that had been involved in arsons and detecting for petroleum
distillates, gasoline and other substances. In 1990, I took a course in
basic serology, and that was just looking at--doing presumptive tests on
various fluids, blood, saliva and determining its origin and also doing
genetic analysis or looking at markers such as enzyme markers. In--going
back a ways now, in 1989, I took a course in crime scene investigation,
and that was a one-week course and up in--taught in eureka by some of
the more well-known individuals in the crime scene investigation
reconstruction field such as Jerry Chisum and Joe Reynerson. In 1989, I
also took a firearm safety course. And doing general criminalistics,
it's important that the criminalist knows the basics of firearms so if
evidence comes into the laboratory, they will be cautious and they won't
be hurt with the guns by any way. And that was just a three-day course
that taught the basics of firearm examination. And that looks like the
extent of my general criminalistics course work through the California
criminalistics institute.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. You mentioned that in 1988, you were hired as a
criminalist. Could you describe the--your assignments during the years
that you worked at the Modesto criminalistics laboratory starting in 1988?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. I started in 1988 shortly after graduation and I
was at the Modesto criminalistics laboratory. That's--this is a
laboratory that's located in the central valley of northern California.
I worked there for three years and the--my primary duty was crime scene
investigation and reconstruction, blood alcohol analysis and drug
analysis. I also did some basic serology at that time. So through the
course of those three years, those were my predominant duties.

*MR. HARMON:* And when you say basic serology, do you mean conventional
serology such as ABO typing, EAP, PGM typing?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. At the Modesto crime lab, the majori--the tests
that were done were primarily presumptive tests and also some ABO testing.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And then did you move to Stockton at some point in 1991?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. In--at the end of the summer in 1991, I
transferred to the Stockton laboratory. And at that time, my primary
duty was doing conventional serology. And also as part of the rotation
basis, crime scene investigation had to be done at that laboratory also,
and also clandestine laboratory investigation.

*MR. HARMON:* And are both the Modesto lab and the Stockton labs, are
they part of the Department of Justice, the State Department of Justice?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, they are.

*MR. HARMON:* And then in 1992, you moved over to the DOJ DNA lab?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. At the end of the summer or I believe it was
August of 1992, I transferred to the DNA laboratory in Berkeley.

*MR. HARMON:* And starting with your initial assignment there, could you
please describe the evolution of your role there from when you first
started in 1992 until the present?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. When I first began with the Department of Justice
at the Berkeley laboratory, I was assigned to their conventional
serology program and in getting the protocols in place and then also
doing analysis of samples that--from the convicted offender program.
We--the conventional serology program or protocols were put into place,
and just as aside, the laboratory decided not to continue on with
conventional serology, but to focus with DNA analysis at that laboratory
and to allow the satellite laboratories to do all the conventional
serology, but to have the Berkeley DNA laboratory focus only on DNA
analysis. So initially I was--I compiled the standard operating
procedures for the laboratory along with another individual, Donna
Dowden, at the laboratory, and I also did 290 analysis. And 290 analysis
are samples from the convicted offender felon program. And these are
samples when convicted offenders are released from prison, a blood
sample is taken from them, and these samples are analyzed and then put
into a database in the laboratory. So I did that for the first, oh,
approximately a year that I was at the DNA laboratory.

*MR. HARMON:* Can I just stop you for a second? When you said you did
that, what kind of tests did you submit those samples to?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That was RFLP analysis and PCR DQ-Alpha analysis.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And then after that, what was your next assignment?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* After that, two individuals, myself and Richard
Showalter, were assigned to the development and in-house evaluation of a
new marker called D1S80, and that began in June of 1994. Richard began
the process in June of 1994.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Why don't we stop that for a second. We'll come back
to that in a minute. Have you given presentations at various meetings in
the area of forensic DNA typing?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I have.

*MR. HARMON:* Could you describe or name the presentations and the
groups and just briefly describe the nature of what your presentation was?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. Referring to my CV once again, in February of
1993, I gave a presentation at the Modesto memorial hospital, and this
was for a trauma symposium. The title of my lecture was "DNA, the latest
crime-solving tool." And this was to--it was approximately an hour
presentation in which I talked about analysis of samples by RFLP and PCR
and how it pertained to--how it related to some of the trauma nurses and
the trauma doctors, the evidence that they had collected.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And then what was the next presentation?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* The next presentation was in Santa Rosa, and that
was--the FBI put on a crime scene investigation course. It was in 1993,
and I was asked to talk about DNA and biological evidence collection.

*MR. HARMON:* And then next after that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* The next several presentations were through the
California association of criminalists--criminalistics, and they
were--one was a DNA study group in San Diego, California; and that was
in October of 1993 and it was on the validation of D1S80. And then in
1994 at the CAC seminar in northern California, I gave a presentation on
PCR typing casework and in court work or courtroom considerations. And
in that talk, I talked about both the validation studies that have been
conducted on D1S80 and also some of the recent cases at that time that
we had done in which D1S80 used in conjunction with DQ-Alpha gave
valuable information.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Now, have you ever testified as an expert witness in
the field of forensic DNA PCR typing?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I have.

*MR. HARMON:* How many times?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Two times.

*MR. HARMON:* And how long ago was the earliest one?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* The first one was in--it was the latter end of last
year, and the second one was in Marin County approximately a month ago.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And have you ever testified as an expert in the
field of forensic serology in your career?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I have.

*MR. HARMON:* How many times?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Approximately five times.

*MR. HARMON:* And in--have you ever testified as an expert in the field
of blood alcohol and controlled substances?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I have.

*MR. HARMON:* How many times?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* The combination of the two, approximately 50 times.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Let's get back to the evolution of the forensic DNA
PCR marker D1S80 in the laboratory. I think you mentioned that--or
strike that. When did the lab first begin its implementation of that PCR
marker D1S80?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* We first began using D1S80 for our casework in April
of 1994. That was after approximately eight months of method development
and evaluating the technology.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Now, when you say "After eight months of method
development and implementing the technology," is this something that the
DOJ lab itself invented or put together?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, it's not.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Had there already been published articles in the
peer review scientific literature about the PCR marker D1S80?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, there was.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And just before the DOJ lab began this
implementation and evaluation of it, could you kind of turn back the
clock and tell us what kinds of scientific literature was out there
already in existence at the time that DOJ began its implementation?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, originally it was--in 1988, an individual by the
name of Dr. Nokamura discovered the location of D1S80, and that was
published in a journal article. At that time, the--the laboratory, I
believe it was salt lake city, continued examining that particular
region, and in 1990, an individual by the name of Dr. Kasai published
the sequence for D1S80.

*THE COURT:* All right. Miss Montgomery, could you spell that for me,
please, Dr.--

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Kasai?

*THE COURT:* Kasai.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* K-A-S-A-I.

*THE COURT:* All right. Thank you.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. That's initially. What other sorts of literature was
out there in existence already at the time that the DOJ began its
implementation of that marker?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, the Europeans were using D1S80 long before the
United States began using it for casework. An individual in Holland by
the name of Sajantila, I believe that's how you pronounce the name,
S-A-J-A-N-T-I-L-A, published some articles on the technique of
visualizing D1S80 and also on the PCR technique. And he also published
the first paper on casework analysis of D1S80's use for casework
analysis. Dr. Budowle of the FBI had published some articles also on
D1S80 use, and then there are various other articles that were published
prior to DOJ using the technique.

*MR. HARMON:* So is there a distinction between a laboratory
implementing a marker that's already been validated in the peer
review--published peer review literature? You see the--you understand
the question?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Could you restate the question?

*MR. HARMON:* Sure. When you implement something, do you implement
something that has never been invented before?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. The D1S80 was examined by a lot of other
laboratories and there was published information out there. And the way
the Department of Justice, we looked at the literature compiled some of
the literature and then did our own evaluation of the technique. And
also at the time that we were doing our evaluation of D1S80, we were
looking at the Roche--it's a company that--a commercially--a commercial
company that manufactures the D1S80 kit, they also had a written
protocol for the use of D1S80. So what we did is, we looked at all this
information, evaluated various techniques and then came up with a method
using the same PCR technique and so we could use D1S80 and examine it
using various conditions.

*MR. HARMON:* Now, was the laboratory already using the PCR marker
DQ-Alpha at the time D1S80 was introduced?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. Our laboratory was.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And do you know Dr. Ed Blake? You mentioned him.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I do.

*MR. HARMON:* To your knowledge, is his laboratory doing D1S80 work now?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* Objection. Irrelevant.

*THE COURT:* Sustained. The jury is to disregard that. Proceed.

*MR. HARMON:* Are you familiar with an article, peer review article in
the journal of forensic science generally known as the casework article
where Dr. Blake is one of the authors?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I am.

*MR. HARMON:* Is the PCR marker D1S80 discussed in that article?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I would need to review that article.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. We'll do that at the break. How many cases have you
actually worked on where you've used the marker D1S80?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I personally have worked on over 20 cases in which I
used D1S80.

*MR. HARMON:* You mentioned that Roche--the company Roche. Is this a
commercial product that's available through Roche, D1S80 marker?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. The primers are available through Roche.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And what else has Roche put together to assist
people that want to use this marker?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, Roche has the full kit. Roche is the company
that also puts out the DQ-Alpha kits. And with the D1S80, they have a
similar kit in which they have all the reagents that are necessary for
the amplification process available in this kit that can be purchased
from them.

*MR. HARMON:* And this is the same company that puts out the DQ-Alpha kit?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* And the same company that puts out the polymarker kit?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* And are they also--people from--scientists from Roche, are
they also some of the authors of articles that are out there about the
D1S80 marker?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Have you been subjected to proficiency testing in your
career at the DOJ lab in the area of forensic DNA typing?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I have.

*MR. HARMON:* Could you please describe the nature, types and results of
the proficiency tests which you've taken?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. Our laboratory has a quality assurance manual
that states the frequency that proficiency tests must be given to
analysts. And for our casework analysts, you have to do two
proficiencies per year. And to date, I have done five proficiency tests
and--which dealt with over 20--I believe that it's 20 samples.

*MR. HARMON:* Can you describe some of the--the nature of some of the
samples that have been in those proficiency tests?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. They're both bloodstains and sexual assault
samples, meaning there's--such as the vaginal swab that has both sperm
and--male contribution sperm and also the female contribution epithelial
cells. So I've done both the bloodstain analysis comparison and also the
sexual assault comparisons.

*MR. HARMON:* Have you made any mistakes in any of those proficiency tests?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I have not.

*MR. HARMON:* Does that mean it's not possible for you to make a mistake?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, it doesn't.

*MR. HARMON:* I believe you mentioned standard operating procedures.
Does your laboratory, the DOJ laboratory have written protocols for all
the different kinds of DNA tests that it performs?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, we do.

*MR. HARMON:* And do you follow those protocols when you perform the tests?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Did you follow those written protocols when you performed
the tests on the evidence in this case?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I did.

*MR. HARMON:* Are those written protocols based on the scientific
literature that you've described that was in existence before the DOJ
lab began investigating the D1S80 marker?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. Our--as--the D1S80 protocol is based on the
scientific literature, but that protocol was written specifically for
D1S80 in our laboratory, but it compiled the literature from the outside.

*MR. HARMON:* Now, in performing the PCR D1S80 tests, Mr. Sims has just
generally described the sorts of positive and negative controls that are
involved in DQ-Alpha tests. Are there also positive and negative
controls when you perform the D1S80 test?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, there are.

*MR. HARMON:* And did you listen to Mr. Sims' testimony?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Parts of it.

*MR. HARMON:* Parts of it? Could you just briefly describe let's say the
role of negative controls in the D1S80 testing process?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. By negative controls, there are two types of
negative controls. One is the negative amplification control. And that's
a sample in which it's used during your setup of the amplification and
either distilled water or a buffer is added to the reaction mix, the
cocktail as we also call it, instead of any DNA. And this should respond
negatively. This should respond negatively when tested by the D1S80
system. Another type of negative control is an extraction blank. And
this is a sample that's taken through the full extraction process. And
that's to demonstrate whether there's any contaminant in your reagents.
And so that also should respond negatively.

*MR. HARMON:* When you say "Respond negatively," could you explain to
the jury what you mean by that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. By responding negatively, meaning no results are
obtained. And you'll see with some of the D1S80 gels--you'll see when I
show the D1S80 gels that when you run the sample, if no bands are
visible, then that's responding negatively. If there is a response in a
negative control, a negative amplification control or a reagent blank,
then that analysis needs to be repeated.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And could you briefly describe the role and the
significance of positive controls in this case?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. A positive control is provided in the D1S80 kit.
And this is a control of a known type. The sample is put through the
amplification process and it needs to respond properly for D1S80. And in
this particular case, you'll see on some of the gels, it's an 1831,
meaning there's two bands that are present, and these two bands need to
be present in the proper locations for the samples to be--for the gel to
be acceptable.

*MR. HARMON:* Could you tell us what you mean by that, why they have to
be in that position for the gel to be acceptable?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, it's testing both the amplification and the
typing process. And if these bands aren't present, then it shows that
there was some--some problem with your amplification or your typing.

*MR. HARMON:* Did you also test substrate controls that were provided to
you in this case?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I did.

*MR. HARMON:* And what was the purpose in testing those substrate
controls that were provided to you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Substrate controls are important to show you what the
background of the area being tested is. In this case, substrate controls
also served as negative controls. There are a few instances where there
was some activity in a substrate control. But in general, these all
responded negatively for the amplification process at D1S80.

*MR. HARMON:* Could you explain what you mean by those few instances?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I believe one of them was addressed by Mr. Sims
yesterday or the day before, and that is a control that he had detected
blood on, substrate control on a garment that he had detected blood on.
And so that responded with a faint reaction in the D1S80 sample.

*MR. HARMON:* And that was from item no. 81, Mr. Goldman's shirt?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it was.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. What other instance were you referring to when you
mentioned that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I believe--

*MR. HARMON:* If you need to look at your notes--

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yeah. I need to refer to my notes.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. Mr. Goldman's shirt was the only one that had
some activity in it.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And Mr. Sims addressed that when he testified
several days ago?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, he did.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Just generally speaking, could you describe your
role in relation to Mr. Sims in this case? What was the official
relationship and how did you get samples from him?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Gary Sims was assigned this case. He was in charge of
the case, and he went through the majority of the extractions and
documentation of all the samples. I was assigned to this case because of
my experience with D1S80. So there are a few samples that I did the
extraction on, the extraction and the analysis on. But predominantly,
Mr. Sims handed--we consulted over how many sample should be amplified
and then I amplified the sample for D1S80 and analyzed it and did the
interpretation on that.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. So the closest--or strike that. You never actually
physically examined and sampled any item of evidence that was sent to
the lab?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. All the evidence went through Gary Sims.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And then he would provide you with whatever it was
agreed upon you needed to do your test?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. I want to ask you if the number items--I'm going to
ask you if these are all items that you processed and achieved D1S80
results on and then we'll show some of them, okay?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay.

*MR. HARMON:* So--did you achieve D1S80 results on the following samples
in this case: Item no. 6 from the Rockingham residence?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Item 9, G19 is the right-hand glove from Rockingham. Stain G1?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* G2?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* G3?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* G4?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* G9?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. HARMON:* G10?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* G11?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* G12?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* G13?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* G14?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Now, we'll shift items to item 13, the pair of socks from
Mr. Simpson's bedroom. Did you obtain results from stain 13A1?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Results were obtained. That work was done by Steve Myers.

*MR. HARMON:* 13A2?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* 13A3?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* 13A4?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Shifting to the other sock, 13B1?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* 13B2?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* And now shifting to the white Bronco, Mr. Simpson's
Bronco, did you obtain results from item 30?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* 31?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Staying with the Bronco, 293?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* From the carpet, 303, 304, 305 from the passenger side of
the console?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And then did you also obtain results--did the
laboratory also obtain results from the following items from the Bundy
residence? These are drops along the walkway. 47, the one closest to the
victims?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* 48 on the Bundy walk?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* 50 on the Bundy walk?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* 52 out in the driveway at Bundy?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Did you also obtain results from clothing items from the
two victims in this case, Mr. Goldman's jeans, item 79?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Mr. Goldman's shirt, which you mentioned to--mentioned a
couple minutes ago, no. 81?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* No. 86, Nicole Brown's dress?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. And that work was done by Steve Myers.

*MR. HARMON:* Steve Myers? Did you also produce results from three items
from the nail clippings and scrapings from Nicole Brown, generally item 84?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* And did you also produce results from Bundy, the three
stains on the rear gate, 115, 116 and 117?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And again, just to lump these together in
categories, some of those results produced mixtures; is that correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's right.

*MR. HARMON:* Where you could tell they were mixtures?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. HARMON:* And we'll show some of them in a couple of minutes, but
were the mixtures for items 9, G1, the glove again, the right-hand glove
from Rockingham?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. That was a mixture.

*MR. HARMON:* 9, G2?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That also was a mixture.

*MR. HARMON:* 9, G4?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. That was a mixture.

*MR. HARMON:* 9, G10?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That also was a mixture.

*MR. HARMON:* 9, G11?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. That was a mixture.

*MR. HARMON:* 9, G12?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. That was a mixture.

*MR. HARMON:* 9, G13?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* A mixture.

*MR. HARMON:* 9, G14?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* And also a mixture.

*MR. HARMON:* And shifting to Mr. Simpson's white Bronco, did you obtain
results that you determined to be mixtures from item 31 on the console?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. That was a mixture.

*MR. HARMON:* Item 303 from the passenger side of the console in the
white Bronco?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. That was a mixture also.

*MR. HARMON:* 304 from the same side of the console in the white Bronco?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* And 305, was that also a mixture from the white Bronco?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it was.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay.

*MR. HARMON:* Now, your Honor, at this time, I would request to have
marked a series of films.

*MR. HARMON:* Miss Montgomery, what do you call these films just so we
don't confuse the jury with autorads? What are they called?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, I call them duplicate copies of the D1S80 gels.

*MR. HARMON:* Could you describe the final product and how we end up
with a piece of film from that product? And what I would like you to do
is just to distinguish between these films and autorads, which this jury
has seen quite a few of.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay. The actual--the final product, the similar film
is used to get a duplicate of the gel. To just show you an original gel,
that--an original gel is placed onto a nylon--oh, it's--well, actually
it's a plastic piece of material and it's dried down. And then to make
copies for court, because we don't want our originals to be submitted to
court, we would like to keep them with the files, to make copies of it,
we just use duplicating film and we expose it to light and then put it
through a film processing apparatus or machine to get a duplicate copy.

*MR. HARMON:* And is that what I have, these films that are produced
from the gel that was dried down?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it is.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Your Honor, I have a total of 18 of them. I would
like to have them marked as 275-A through R. I think that's the right
number.

*THE COURT:* So marked, 275-A through R.

/(Peo's 275-A through R for id - films)/

//*MR. HARMON:* And I don't intend to show all of these. I intend to
show a through h, and I've got them separated out. I'm not sure
how--perhaps I can just describe each one for the record and then we'll
give it the right letter then, your Honor?

*THE COURT:* All right.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And I've shown some of them to counsel. I think I
showed you this one yesterday.

/(Discussion held off the record between the Deputy District Attorney
and Defense counsel.)/

//*THE COURT:* How are we going to do these, Mr. Harmon?

*MR. HARMON:* Excuse me, your Honor? On the elmo.

*THE COURT:* On the elmo?

*MR. HARMON:* Yes.

*THE COURT:* All right.

*MR. HARMON:* In fact, we're going to use the telestrator a little bit
too. So, Miss Montgomery, why don't you come down here.

*THE COURT:* All right. Miss Montgomery, would you keep your voice up
while you're down there, please?

*MR. HARMON:* And, Miss Montgomery, even though I'm behind you, talk to
the jury so they can hear you better than I can, okay?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. HARMON:* Your Honor, the first copy that I would like to put on
the elmo is just an illustrative film which Miss Montgomery has nothing
to do with the casework in this case. So may that be 275-A?

*THE COURT:* 275-A.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Miss Montgomery--

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Could you shift it so it's--so the sample's at the
top. Whoops. There we go. And do you think--thanks.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Miss Montgomery, can we get the jury oriented to
what all those markings are and then describe the significance of 275-A?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. This is a D1S80 gel. And for orientation
purposes--let's see. Ah, there we go. Okay. The origin is here
/(Indicating)/. And this is where--it's up at the top. You can't see on
this particular gel, but that's where the samples are loaded. And
they're distinct wells, separated. Each sample is separated. This
/(Indicating)/--the ones with the multiple banding patterns, these are
ladders and these are made by the company. They're provided within the
kit and they range from a 14 allele down here--whoops. There we go. Hold
on. 14 allele or a 14 band all the way up to a 41. And the way--the way
I like to look at D1S80 is the marriage of PCR and RFLP. And by saying
"The marriage of PCR and RFLP," it's using a PCR base system, but it's
looking at repetitive regions or repetitive sequences of DNA within the
geno much like Dr. Cotton described with the RFLP process. So these are
repeat sequences ranging from 14 repeat units all the way up to 41
repeat units. And what the company did is, they made some of the alleles
bolder so it's--for ease of picking out the alleles. And the ones they
made bolder were the 18 allele, which is 18 repeat units, and that's
right here /(Indicating)/, the 24 and then also the 31 and the 34 repeat
units.

*MR. HARMON:* Is it true that everybody matches some allele or some band
in that ladder?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. This is termed a "Discreet allele system,"
meaning that unlike the RFLP process, with this process, you could use
the ladder, the 14 to 41, as a ruler or a reference point and then just
look at your evidence sample or your unknown sample and match up the
band to the corresponding ladder lane. So--for example, this--oh, let's
see. That /(Indicating)/--

*MR. HARMON:* Sample 1, you've just identified--

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* The sample right there with the--this is moving. That
is considered an 18 allele. And if you look at this one /(Indicating)/--

*MR. HARMON:* In sample 2, you've put an arrow?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yeah. Sample 2, that's a 24 allele or 24 repeat.

*MR. HARMON:* Now, are some of these more common than others?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, some of them are. And what the company did--let
me put that down. What the company did is, the ones that they made
darker are the ones that tend to be more commonly seen in the
population. So as you can see on this gel /(Indicating)/, the--I'll just
make lines. Whoa. Okay. Let's not do the line. The 18 allele, the one
right here /(Indicating)/, is seen in three of the samples, and that's a
total of what, 13 samples.

*MR. HARMON:* Now, who are those people, samples 1 through 12?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* These are just individuals that were taken from our
convicted offender database. They're individuals that have been released
from--from prison and their samples were run--their DNA was extracted
and then they were run on the D1S80 system. But then if you also look
back to Mr. Harmon's question, if you look at this /(Indicating)/, the
24, you can see that there are four individuals out of the 13. I'm
saying 13 individuals because I'm looking at the positive control also.
It would be 14 individuals. Four of these have a 24 allele. But by
looking at the second allele, you can differentiate between all 12 of
these individuals.

*MR. HARMON:* So they share one band or frequently in common, but
they're different with the other band quite frequently?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* And among these 12 people, they're totally different?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. HARMON:* So let me put that another way. From among these randomly
selected 12 people, do any of the 12 share the same two bands?

*MR. BLASIER:* Your Honor, I would object to the "Randomly selected."
There's no foundation that that occurred.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. Of these 12 individuals, none of them are the
same type. But it's not unusual for individuals to be--there are
instances where individuals are the same type.

*MR. HARMON:* Why don't we just start from left to right just so the
jury can get a sense for how you can look at that and describe which
type is there starting with sample 1.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay. Sample 1, if we count 14--I guess I should go
back to talk about the ladder. It goes from 14 repeats all the way up to
41 repeats, but the 15 repeat's missing. So we go from 14, 16, 17, 18,
19, so on. 24, this one's bold again. So sample no. 1 would be an 18,
25. Sample no. 2 would be a 24, 25. Sample no. 3 would be a 24
homozygote, meaning they have--that individual only has a single banding
pattern.

*MR. HARMON:* Why is that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* What they inherited from their parents was the same
allele, 24 allele from both the mother and the father.

*MR. HARMON:* All right.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* And then this one--you know, we could continue on with
this.

*MR. HARMON:* Would you do that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay. This one is a 22, 26. And then this one--sample
no. 5 is a single-banded pattern, a homozygote.

*MR. HARMON:* Could you just give us a little better explanation? Why is
there just one band there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, there's just one band visualized because both of
the bands--the individual is a 24 comma--or not in this case. But this
case, the individual is a 28, a 28, 28. And so both of the bands are
running into the same location. So all you're seeing is a single-banded
pattern on that individual.

*MR. HARMON:* And how can you tell there are really two bands there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* You're--this has since been optimized. So you would
see the banding pat--equal intensity of the two alleles that are present
or the two bands that are present on an individual. This is a reference
bloodstain, and a single band is observed. And in this system, it hasn't
been found that any of the samples run off the gel or anything such as
that. So if you see a single-banded pattern, you can assign that a
genotype or what you're observing and the type of the actual sample.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Why don't you move to sample 6.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Sample 6 would be--once again, I have to--you know, I
have to get my orientation and count from the 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. So
this would be a 28 and this would be a 34 /(Indicating)/. And you could
see that 34 band's a little more intense than the other bands. And that
once again is for ease of--so you can quickly call or you can readily
identify types without having to count from the very bottom up to the top.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And then sample 7?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Sample 7 is a 20 because 18, 19, 20, and then a 28.
And you can see three individuals, no. 5, 6 and 7, all share the same
allele.

*MR. HARMON:* But not any other allele?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Let's go to sample 8. How would you type that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* The sample no. 8 is--once again, here's an 18 allele
and 22 /(Indicating)/.

*THE COURT:* All right. Mr. Harmon, I think we get the point.

*MR. HARMON:* Good. Okay. Then we can move on.

*MR. HARMON:* Why don't we move on to 275-B, which--you assign numbers
to each of these gels when you run them; is that right?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. HARMON:* And let's move to AG148. Do you recognize that number?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. The number sounds familiar.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Could we put 275-B, which we'll identify as gel AG148.

*MR. HARMON:* Now, what's the purpose of this first gel, the--or strike
that. Are those labels normally on your gels, the O.J. Simpson, R.
Goldman, N. Brown labels?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. Those labels were placed on the gel for--to
identify what sample is in that particular lane.

*MR. HARMON:* And why did you just run--is there any evidence run on
this gel, 275-B?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. HARMON:* Why did you run just the three reference samples without
any evidence on them?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, for two reasons. First of all, this gel
was--these samples were run prior to any evidence coming into the
laboratory. The only evidence that we had obtained were these three
samples. And as I stated earlier, Gary Sims had examined the reference
samples and placed a portion into a tube, and then I extracted these
samples and analyzed them for D1S80.

*MR. HARMON:* Why did you do that just on the reference samples?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, for two reasons. First of all, the L.A. District
Attorney's office asked me to see if we could differentiate between
these three individuals.

*MR. HARMON:* Why was that important?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That was important to determine whether this--the
evidence was sent to our laboratory for D1S80 analysis. If we couldn't
distinguish between these three individuals, then it wouldn't offer any
more information. At that time, they wanted to know if these three
individuals could be differentiated.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Could you briefly describe the layout of this gel?
You've already pointed out the ladders. Are there six ladders on this gel?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Seven.

*MR. HARMON:* There's seven? There's one. What else, starting from left
to right inside the left-hand ladder, is in each lane?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay. I should have stated on the last gel. What we
have--we have a convention--conventional way of setting up these gels.
And first is to, after your first ladder, is to place the positive
amplification control. And this is the--once again, the amplification
control that's provided in the D1S80 kit. And the amplification control
is an 18, 31. And the next lane on this gel is a negative amplification,
a negative amplification blank, and this produced no results. And then a
ladder, and this is a QC sample /(Indicating)/, and I believe Mr. Sims
went into the explanation of what a QC sample was. And this is run--

*THE COURT:* Excuse me. Does that mean quality control?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. QC stands for quality control sample.

*MR. HARMON:* And the next lane over?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* And the next lane over is an extraction blank. And
this provided no banding pattern.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And then we've got a lane labeled "O.J. Simpson"?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* After the ladder?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. HARMON:* That's from Mr. Simpson's known reference blood?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it is.

*MR. HARMON:* And what type was Mr. Simpson with the D1S80 marker?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* He's a 24, 25, and you can see there's the 24
/(Indicating)/--well--24, 25.

*MR. HARMON:* And then Mr. Goldman, what type did he produce?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Mr. Goldman is a single-banded pattern, a 24 homozygote.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. That means he inherited the same size band from his
mother and his father?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. HARMON:* Could you move that or could we maybe rotate it 90 degrees
and come up from--

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Sure.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Now, that's Mr. Goldman? He's a 24. So by
coincidence, he shares one of these bands with Mr. Simpson?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct. And as I stated, the 24 allele is one of the
more common alleles.

*MR. HARMON:* Are there population studies that continue to be produced
that compile the frequency of all these bands with the D1S80 system?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* And I believe you just said 24. Is that the most common
allele?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yeah. It's one of the more common alleles that is seen.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And when you typed Nicole Brown's known blood
sample, what type did she produce?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* She came out an 18 homozygote, which is one of the
other more common alleles that is seen. The 18 and 24 alleles are the
most common alleles that are seen in the population.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Now, let's just stop here for a second and I want to
ask you, is it necessary to run these reference samples again with all
the other tests that you performed on the evidence in this case?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, it's not.

*MR. HARMON:* Why not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* If you know the results of the individuals, you don't
need to run them on each subsequent gel that's run. There's a limitation
on the number of samples that can be run on each--on each gel, and
that's 20 samples or 20 lanes. And that doesn't include all the controls
or the ladders. So to run them once is sufficient for the analysis.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Could we--

/(Discussion held off the record between the Deputy District Attorneys.)/

//*MR. HARMON:* Could we move on to 275-C, your Honor, which--

/(Discussion held off the record between the Deputy District Attorneys.)/

//*MR. HARMON:* 275-C, which is AG168.

*MR. HARMON:* Do you recognize that number, AG168?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. The number is familiar.

*MR. HARMON:* Your Honor, I would like to at the same time I do this
because of that samples that are on there to have the jury be able to
see the photo boards from Bundy and Rockingham, those are exhibits 120
and 165, so we can see the relationship with these items. Could we do that?

*MR. BLASIER:* I have no objection to that. May I request that any time
we put arrows on something, we print it out? Apparently that last one
didn't get printed out.

*MR. HARMON:* I didn't intend for it, but from now on, I will. Sure.

*THE COURT:* All right. And at the break, we'll reproduce that other one
on 275-B.

*MR. BLASIER:* Thank you.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay.

*THE COURT:* Mr. Fairtlough.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. While Mr. Fairtlough is getting those boards out,
essentially you have the same generic layout of the gel. This is a
different gel than 148, the one we just saw; is that correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. HARMON:* And I notice you have lanes labeled with Mr. Simpson's
name on it, Mr. Goldman's name on it and Nicole Brown's name on it. Why
did you include them on this gel?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* They were included on this gel because I had extra
room on the gel to run their samples again. And I--for the analysis. And
it's also good, you know, just to--for the first gel, I wanted to see
all the samples placed together.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And did Mr. Simpson's reference type produce the
same type as we just saw on 275-B, exhibit 275-B?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it did.

*MR. HARMON:* And did Mr. Goldman's produce the same type as we saw in
275-B?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* And, Miss Brown's, did her blood sample also produce the
same type as 275-C?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it did.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Now, if we could just--

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Actually this gel is--some of the samples are fainter.
So I'll need to get my glasses.

*MR. HARMON:* Sure. Could we lower it? There we go. Miss Montgomery,
let's start out with the stain that was labeled Rockingham no. 6 that's
displayed on the Rockingham exhibit board, and it's been identified
as--individually as photo 120-C. What type did that produce in the D1S80
system?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's a 24, 25. And--

*MR. HARMON:* Go ahead.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* As you can see, there's the 24 allele and
there's--whoops--there's the 25 allele /(Indicating)/.

*MR. HARMON:* And that's consistent with Mr. Simpson?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* And--

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Actually I think it would be clearer to put the arrows
this way /(Indicating)/.

*MR. HARMON:* Well--

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Is that clearer?

*MR. HARMON:* Well, you're not going to be able to do it across the
board though.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay.

*MR. HARMON:* Well, can we get it coming in straight from the top?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. Okay.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Now, which allele is that from the top?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's the 25.

*MR. HARMON:* Would you mark that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/

*MR. HARMON:* In fact, let's--just to make it easier then, why don't we
just go all the way across either the top or the bottom. The other band
is a 24?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct. These are--these bands that I'm pointing to
are 24's /(Indicating)/.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And the top bands are 25's? Could you mark all of
those, please.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/

*MR. HARMON:* Could we go over to Mr. Simpson's reference type and show
us how they correspond?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. This is the 25, and there's the 24 allele
/(Indicating)/.

*MR. HARMON:* So you got the same results from the stain in Mr.
Simpson's driveway with a D1S80 marker as you did with 47, the drop
closest to the victims, 48 next down the walkway and 50, the next one
down the walkway?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. HARMON:* And those results were inconsistent with Mr. Goldman and
Miss Brown?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Assuming a single source, yes. It's inconsistent with
Mr. Goldman and Nicole Brown can be eliminated because her 18 band isn't
seen in the bottom region of any of those samples.

*MR. HARMON:* There was no--was there any indication of a mixture in any
of those stains?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, there wasn't. By looking at the DQ-Alpha results
also, there's no indication of a mixture on that--on those particular
samples.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Why don't we--can we capture that one? And that will
be--

*THE COURT:* That will be People's 275-C(1).

*MR. HARMON:* Thank you, your Honor.

/(Peo's 275-C(1) for id = printout)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Are we done with the Rockingham exhibit?

*MR. HARMON:* Let me make sure. Yes, we are.

*THE COURT:* With regards to this? All right. Mr. Fairtlough, how about
if we change places so the jurors can see the Bundy exhibit because it's
too low with the use of the screen.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* Yes, your Honor. I will need to shift easels.

*MR. BLASIER:* Your Honor, I have an objection and I think we need to
approach.

*THE COURT:* All right. With the court reporter, please.

/(The following proceedings were held at the bench:)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. We're over at the sidebar. Mr. Blasier, you
had an objection?

*MR. BLASIER:* Yes. I thought we had objected and agreed that that term
"Bundy trail" could not be used.

*THE COURT:* The slide has "Bundy trail" on it?

*MR. BLASIER:* Yes. Three times.

*MS. CLARK:* What's wrong with "Bundy trail"?

*MR. BLASIER:* The Judge ruled it was not a proper term to use in
connection with these samples.

*THE COURT:* Yes.

*MS. CLARK:* You did?

*THE COURT:* Walkway as opposed to--Bundy walk on these things. How many
more of these films do you have?

*MR. HARMON:* If I can check--I think that's the last one. So if you want--

*THE COURT:* All right.

*MR. HARMON:* I don't know how we fix this one.

*THE COURT:* All right. Well, unfortunately, it's been up there for
quite awhile now. So at this time, I don't know that there's much more
we can do about it.

*MR. COCHRAN:* Perhaps it should be modified at the break.

*THE COURT:* Yes. I'll ask them--I don't know. I'll ask them to reletter
that if possible. Thank you.

/(The following proceedings were held in open court:)/

//*THE COURT:* And, Mr. Harmon, 10:30. All right. Madam reporter, you set?

*THE COURT REPORTER:* Yes.

*THE COURT:* All right. Mr. Harmon.

*MR. HARMON:* Thank you, your Honor. Could we have the Bronco photo and
result board up there next?

*THE COURT:* I'm sorry, Mr. Harmon. Are you going to do the Bundy--

*MR. HARMON:* Oh. Item 48, 47 and 50. Could we change boards now, Mr.
Fairtlough, to the Bronco photo and result board, exhibits 172 and 260?
And I'd like to have marked as 275-D, copy of gel AG174.

*THE COURT:* 275-D as in David?

*MR. HARMON:* Yes, your Honor.

*MR. HARMON:* While we're getting the board set up, could you describe
the samples that are on 275-D, which is your AG174?

/(Peo's 275-D(1) for id = photograph)/

//*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. These are, once again, the reference samples
from three individuals, O.J. Simpson being a 24, 25, Ronald Goldman
being a 24 homozygote and Nicole Brown being an 18, 18, an 18 homozygote.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And now, do we lose a little fidelity when we
project these copies up on the screen?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, we do.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. How do you visualize these things when you're
looking for them for the first time to interpret them and write the report?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I look at the actual gel after it's been dried down
and I do my interpretation based on--or I write the results that I see
at the time on a run sheet and then also a second reader reads those
gels. That can be done at a different--or later date though. These are
blue copies. And first of all, the blue copy is--represents what the
actual gel--what was present on the actual gel. But when you project it
up here, you tend to lose--it's not as sharp and it's not as dark. But I
think when you see these printouts, you'll be able to see it.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And you have the three reference samples run again?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* They produce the same results?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Item no. 30, which was taken from the Bronco center
console, could you tell us what results you obtained from that sample?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. A 24 allele and a 25 allele. And you can see it
right /(Indicating)/.

*MR. HARMON:* And you're marking them with the pink arrows?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/

*MR. HARMON:* They're red arrows?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Red arrows.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And what about Bronco 31, the other center console
sample that was provided to you? What results or what bands did you see
there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* On D1S80, a 24 band and also the 25.

*MR. HARMON:* Now, what conclusion can you reach on the 24, 25 with
respect to the possibility there's a mixture there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, the interpretation had to be based also on the
results of the DQ-Alpha. And by looking at the DQ-Alpha results in
conjunction with these D1S80 results, it was determined it was a
mixture. By just looking at the D1S80 results alone, mixture can't be
determined.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. But if there were a mixture of Mr. Simpson and Mr.
Goldberg, would it look just like what you see in 31, the console stain?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. Neither of them could be eliminated from these
samples.

*MR. HARMON:* Because they share a 24 allele?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Why don't you move on to Bronco 293, which was from
the driver's side carpet? Can you tell us what results you obtained from
that sample?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay. On this sample, there's a single-banded pattern,
and it's an 18.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And who was that consistent with? Could we make that
18 a different color if you would?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Sure /(Witness complies)/.

*MR. HARMON:* We've now switched over to green?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Green.

*MR. HARMON:* And you're going to put a green arrow by the 18 allele?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* And who is that consistent with?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's consistent with Nicole Brown.

*MR. HARMON:* And is it inconsistent with Mr. Simpson and Mr. Goldberg?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it is.

*MR. HARMON:* Could you put a green arrow over there by Nicole Brown's
single-banded pattern from her reference sample?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/

*MR. HARMON:* And 305, could you first describe what's in 305? And then
we'll try to mark it.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay. 305 is a mixture and there are three bands
present, the 24, the 25 and an 18.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* And--

*MR. HARMON:* I'm sorry.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It's slightly difficult to see that 18 from here. But
when you see the actual blue copy, you'll be able to visualize it.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Could you put a green arrow down by the 18 in sample
305, the Bronco sample 305?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/

*MR. HARMON:* And then--and then--and then let's go back--let's go back
to the red 24, 25 bands that you saw.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay. And there's a 24 and the 25 /(Indicating)/.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And you've marked 24 and 25. Now, you said we know
that's a mixture. How do you know that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* You know it's a mixture because there are more than
two bands present. There are three bands present in that sample, a 24, a
25 and also the 18. And also, the relative intensities of the band. The
18 allele's much weaker than the 24 and 25 alleles.

*MR. HARMON:* And what's the significance of that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It shows that the 18 is a minor contribution in that
sample.

*MR. HARMON:* Could you explain a little bit better what that means?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. It means the amount of the 18 allele is less than
the amount of the 24 allele or the 25 allele.

*MR. HARMON:* And is there something about the way this whole kit is
designed that will help you when you see something faint like that
interpret it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yeah. Both the kit and also the in-laboratory
evaluation that the Department of Justice did for D1S80, we optimize the
system so when you have a neat bloodstain, meaning a--or DNA, a sample
from one individual, that you'll get equal intensity of the two--the two
bands. So in this case, what you could see is, there's not equal
intensity of those bands and there's a weaker component down there at
the 18.

*MR. HARMON:* And are the results that you produced for 305 based on
D1S80 alone, are they consistent with a mixture from the three reference
samples in this case, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Brown and--Mr. Goldman and Miss
Brown?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. None--those--neither or none of those individuals
can be excluded as a possible source of the DNA in the Bronco stain, no.
305.

*MR. HARMON:* And the DQ-Alpha results also contribute more information
to that mixture; is that true?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* And that they're still consistent with that mixture?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. HARMON:* Your Honor, I can move to another one or I can stop now.

*THE COURT:* All right. Tell you what. Let's take our break five minutes
early because we'll have to do another set of exhibits here. Ladies and
gentlemen, please remember all of my admonitions; don't discuss this
case amongst yourselves, don't form any opinions about the case, don't
conduct any deliberations until the matter has been submitted to you.
Also, do not allow anyone to communicate with you with regard to the
case. And we'll take a break for about 15 minutes. All right. We'll
stand in recess.

/(Recess.)/

/(The following proceedings were held in open court, out of the presence
of the jury:)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Mr. Harmon, back on the record. Do you want to
get your exhibits out?

*MR. HARMON:* Excuse me, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* Do you want to get the next set of exhibits up.

*MR. HARMON:* Yes, your Honor, the sock photo board.

*THE COURT:* All right. Do you have them available?

*MR. HARMON:* Yes, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* All right. Let's have the jurors, please.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*THE COURT:* Why don't you just hold them down there, Mr. Clarke, just
until we are ready to go.

/(Brief pause.)/

/(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury:)/

//*THE COURT:* Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Please be seated. The
record should reflect we have now been rejoined by all the members of
our jury panel. All parties are again present. All right. Mr. Harmon,
you may continue with your direct examination.

/(Discussion held off the record between the Deputy District Attorneys.)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Let's proceed.

*MR. HARMON:* Your Honor, at this time I would like to have marked as
275-E, for identification, gel number AG2-44 and I will give it to Mr.
Fairtlough.

*THE COURT:* All right. 275-E.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. HARMON:* And we have displayed for the jury People's 262 and
260-A which are respectively the socks results board and the sock photo
board.

*MR. HARMON:* Now, Miss Montgomery, could you please describe, skipping
over the positive and negative control--could you please describe the
samples which are of interest to us in this case.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. These are two samples from the sock. Umm, two
different locations. And you could see them--the first one described as
b-1 is a single-banded 18 and the second one described as B2 its a
single-banded pattern also and that is an 18, 18.

*MR. HARMON:* That is consistent with Nicole Brown?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes it is.

*MR. HARMON:* And it is inconsistent with the Defendant, Mr. Simpson?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Inconsistent with Mr. Goldman?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Now, we are just showing some of the film in this case for
the jury's edification; is that correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right.

*MR. HARMON:* The result board actually lists other D1S80 results which
were produced in this case. Are those in this package of film that we
have as well?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, they are.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Okay. Why don't we move on to 275-F, which is gel
AG62-65. Could we have the glove result and photo boards, which are
People's exhibit 272-A and B.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. We will mark the printout from 275-E as 275-E(1).

/(Peo's 275-E(1) for id = photograph)/

//*MR. HARMON:* Miss Montgomery, could you, while we are getting the
board set up, could you please describe the samples that were on this
gel that produced the copy of the film which we have labeled 275-F?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. This is DNA extracted from four different
locations on the glove and G11--G11 is a mixture and this is--

*MR. HARMON:* How can you tell it is a mixture?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* There are--you need to see the original or the copy
that is going to be printed out. From here it is a little difficult to
see the minor contributions, but what you would see is the major banding
of a 24 and so that is a major type of a 24, 24 and then you can also
see a weaker 25 allele and on this one there is also a weaker 18 allele.

*MR. HARMON:* Could we just use some--let's stay with 18. Could we use a
different color or let's sort these out by color. The 18 allele, could
you put an arrow to the left of it and then we will change colors and go
up to 24 and 25, so could you get it real close there. So you have got a
green arrow next to the stain 9G11. That represents the 18 allele?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Now, from the three reference samples who is that
consistent with?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That is consistent with Nicole Brown. She can't be
eliminated as a contributor of that weaker 18 allele.

*MR. HARMON:* How do you know that is a mixture?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* You can tell it is a mixture for two reasons: First of
all, because there are three bands present in the sample. And secondly,
because of the relative intensity of the banding pattern. As I stated,
that 24 is more intense than either the 18 or the 25. In this sample it
appears the 18 and 25 are relatively equal intensity to each other, but
yet that 24 is much stronger.

*MR. HARMON:* So what does that mean?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That means that there is more than one individual that
could have contributed to that sample.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And from among the three individuals could you mark
the 24 and 25 alleles using different colored arrows, please, to the
left. So you are putting a red arrow by--to the left of--

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Would you like a different.

*MR. HARMON:* --the 24 allele and could you use a different color for
the 25 allele.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/

*MR. HARMON:* Now, considering the three reference samples that were
provided to you in this case that you didn't run on this gel, what--what
can you say about the--whether or not those three--three reference types
could be contained in the stain at 9G11?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* None of the individuals, none of the three reference
samples, O.J. Simpson, Nicole Brown or Ronald Goldman, could be excluded
as a source of this sample.

*MR. HARMON:* And let me ask you that same question about those three
people and what is the significance about the weakness of the bands with
respect to the 24 allele? Can you say anything more about how these
things line up in terms of intensity?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, you also can--D1S80 was--I mean, DQ-Alpha was
done on these samples also and by using both the DQ-Alpha results and
the D1S80 results you can sort this out a little further, and--

*MR. HARMON:* I don't think DQ-Alpha was done on this sample, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm sorry, you are right. DQ-Alpha was not done on
this sample.

*MR. HARMON:* So can you say anything more about the relative
intensities in terms of the combinations of the three reference samples
in this case?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I can say who could be the major contributor of the
sample and who could be the minor contributor, and I can say of those
three individuals none of them could be eliminated as a source of this
bloodstain.

*MR. HARMON:* What could be the type of the major contributor in this
case, based on your observations on this stain?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* By looking at lane G11, glove 9, lane G11, the major
contributor is a 24 homozygote and then the minor components are an 18
allele and a 25 allele.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And from among the three reference types is any one
of them a 24 homozygote?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Who is that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Ronald Goldman.

*MR. HARMON:* And is the 25 allele unique to one of the three reference
samples in this case?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Who is that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* 24, 25 is the type of O.J. Simpson.

*MR. HARMON:* So from among those three people, Nicole Brown, Ronald
Goldman and Mr. Simpson, Mr. Simpson is the only one that has a 25 allele?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Of those three individuals, that's correct.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And the population frequency data actually describes
how many other people might have the 25 allele?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Let's move on to G12. Could you describe, before you
put any arrows on it, describe the band that you are able to see on the
original and the blue copy that appear in 9G12 if you will?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. G12 is also a mixture and from here I'm having a
difficult time seeing that--the minor contributor, but the minor type,
if you--when you look at the gel you will see an 18 band in the 18
region. Umm, so in this sample the major contributor is a 24 homozygote
and the minor contributor has an 18 allele present.

*MR. HARMON:* And are those two types consistent with the two victims in
this case, Mr. Goldman and Miss Brown?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, they.

*MR. HARMON:* When you say, "Major contributor, minor contributor," are
you saying that it is a mixture of those two types?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* By major and minor I am able to say what the major
type is. As far as the minor components, what I can say is an 18 allele
is the minor component but that 18 could be an 18 homozygote or it could
be a 18, 24.

*MR. HARMON:* So it could be just a one-banded 18 pattern which would be
consistent with Nicole Brown?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. HARMON:* Or there might be another 24 band that is hidden under the
24 band? Is that what you are saying?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's right, or it could be an 18, 24.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Can we try to get some arrows in that--let's keep
green with the 18, if you will.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/

*MR. HARMON:* Can we get that green?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Green.

*MR. HARMON:* And then keep the red with the 24 allele.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Let's move over to G13. Will you describe what you
see there and then we will discuss it.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. G13 is similar to G11. The interpretation is the
same on that sample where it is a mixture, there is more than one band
present. There is a major type and there are minor alleles. The major
type is a 24, 24 and the minor alleles are an 18 and a 25. And once
again, you need to see the printed out copy.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Now, let's look back on G11. The results that you
have described for G13, are they essentially the same results as you
have seen in G11?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* Are they different in any way?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Umm, the 25 and the 18 are slightly weaker in G13, but
in general the same pattern--the same pattern is seen in G13 as G11.

*MR. HARMON:* And would you--strike that. So the comments that you made
about G11 would apply to G13 as well?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. HARMON:* Could we, using the same colors that we used in G11, could
we try to get some arrows in there to show where those bands are.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. You have marked with a red arrow the 24 allele?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* This is getting a bit messy.

*MR. HARMON:* Now, you have got the pink arrow on the 25 allele in G13.
And then you have marked the 18 allele with the green arrow?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right.

*MR. HARMON:* Once again, in this sample from among the three reference
types that were provided to you, Mr. Simpson is the only one that has
that 25 allele; is that correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Let's move over to G14, if you will, and describe
what you observed in G14.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* G14--G14 has a major contribution of a 24 homozygote
and in the 18 region there is what I call a possible 18. There wasn't a
clear distinct band in that region so I wasn't confident to call it a band.

*MR. HARMON:* Can you show us where that is with an arrow?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/

*MR. HARMON:* Is there something that is more readily apparent if you
actually look at the original and look the copy?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* From here I can't see anything in that region. When
you look at the original gel or the copy of the gel, what you could see
is a darkening in that region, but as I stated, it is not clearly
defined and I would not call it definitely an 18 band being present.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. What do you see there in that lane for G14?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* There is a major--there is a 24 allele present, so the
mayor source of the sample is a 24 homozygote.

*MR. HARMON:* And I believe Mr. Sims described, because of that possible
trace 18, that one could not exclude Nicole Brown?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* If that is a band, then no, Nicole Brown could not be
eliminated, but as I was saying, I don't feel confident calling it a
band, so if it is a band, then she can't be excluded, but since I won't
call that a definite band, then that is--

*MR. HARMON:* So from among the three reference types who would--

*MR. BLASIER:* Objection. I don't think she was finished.

*THE COURT:* Yes.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* So that was--so this one I am able to say what the
major type is on the sample. As far as minor contributor, I am unable to
say anything about it.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Because you are not sure there is one?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Exactly.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. So let's look at what you do see there. Who is not
excluded as the source of this stain on G14?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I could not eliminate Ronald Goldman as being a
possible source since he is a 24 homozygote and the pattern that is seen
in G14 is 24, 24.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Could we capture that, your Honor, and mark that
275-F(1).

*THE COURT:* Yes.

/(Peo's 275-F(1) for id = photograph)/

//*MR. HARMON:* I would like to move on--I'm going to display the nail
board, your Honor, with those photos at the bottom, the nail kit and the
other photos.

*THE COURT:* All right.

*MR. HARMON:* And as well as the Bundy result board. The nail board is
People's exhibit 220 and the Bundy result board is 259.

/(Discussion held off the record between the Deputy District Attorneys.)/

//*MR. HARMON:* And at the same time I would like to have marked as
275-G for identification gel a G293.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*THE COURT:* Mr. Fairtlough, let me see 220 before you get it up
there. Just briefly.

*MR. FAIRTLOUGH:* Yes, your Honor.

*MR. HARMON:* Your Honor, do you want to see those photos? That is the one--

*THE COURT:* I just want to make sure my recollection is--yeah. Mr.
Bancroft, would you avoid 220, please.

/(Brief pause.)/

/(Discussion held off the record between the Deputy District Attorneys.)/

//*MR. HARMON:* Okay. While Mr. Fairtlough is getting the board set up,
could you describe the samples of interest that were provided to you for
D1S80 typing in this case?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. These were extracted samples from the fingernail
scrapings of Nicole Simpson--Nicole Brown.

*MR. HARMON:* Scrapings and clippings?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* And as soon as we get the board up there, we can relate
the items, because it doesn't seem like we have enough room there. Why
don't we slide the--could you justify in parenthesis and describe the
items so the jury can correlate them. What is your 45B number which is
labeled fingernail--fingernail 84 and then in parenthesis 45B? What is that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yeah. I will have to look at my notes for that.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MS. MONTGOMERY:* 45B is the right hand fingernail scrapings.

*MR. HARMON:* What is 46B, your 46B?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* 46B is the left hand fingernail scrapings.

*MR. HARMON:* And what is 45A-1B represent?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* 45A is the right fingernail clippings. 1B refers to
nearby blood on the same nail.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And would you describe, starting from left to right,
45B, what results did you obtain with the D1S80 marker when you typed
your no. 45B?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Those were all single-banded patterns of 18 homozygotes.

*MR. HARMON:* That is consistent with Nicole Brown?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it is.

*MR. HARMON:* Could we use--I think we have been using green for the 18
allele. Could you put an arrow for each of the three sample that gave
you the sale result, the 18 allele?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Is there any question in your mind that they are the
same result for all three of those samples?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. May we capture that, your Honor, as 275-G(1)?

*THE COURT:* Yes.

/(Peo's 275-G(1) for id = photograph)/

//*MR. HARMON:* And the last--if--board and results, if we can keep the
Bundy result board up there and put the Bundy photo board, which is
People's exhibit 165 up there, at the same time I would like to have
marked as People's 275-H for identification gel a G295.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. HARMON:* Now, Miss Montgomery, what I would like to talk about is
items 115, 116 and 117 so as not to confuse them with photo I.d. Numbers
which are in the upper left-hand corner and then just down below it, the
items from the rear gate at Bundy.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay.

*MR. HARMON:* And you performed D1S80 typing on those samples as well?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I did.

*MR. HARMON:* And could you please describe your results and then I will
ask you to mark them, if you will.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. These all came back 24, 25, and as you can see--

*MR. HARMON:* We are using red for 24, 25. Why don't you mark 115.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/

*MR. HARMON:* Your Honor, have we marked 275-H on the record?

*THE COURT:* Yes, a G295.

*MR. HARMON:* Thank you.

*MR. HARMON:* So that is a 24, 25?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it is.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And would you move over to 116 and describe the
results that you obtained on 116.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* On 116 it is also a 24, 25.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Would you put arrows that show where those bands are.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. And on the 117, the rear gate stain, could you
describe the results and put arrows to show where they are.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, the same results were obtained with sample 117
and that is a 24 allele and a 25. /(Witness complies.)/

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Are those results--strike that. Is 115 consistent
with Mr. Simpson's D1S80 type?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it is.

*MR. HARMON:* Is 116 consistent with Mr. Simpson's D1S80 type?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it is.

*MR. HARMON:* Is 117 consistent with Mr. Simpson's D1S80 type?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it is.

*MR. HARMON:* Are those three types, three results, 115, 116, 117, are
they consistent with one another?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, they are.

*MR. HARMON:* Are all three of those results inconsistent with having
come from Ronald Goldman alone?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, yes, because by using--by looking at the D1S80
results and also by looking at the DQ-Alpha results, there is no
indication that a mixture is present here and so on this the type of the
individual will be a 24, 25.

*MR. HARMON:* And Nicole Brown excluded as a source of those stains?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. There was no 18 allele detected on any of these
stains.

*MR. HARMON:* Your Honor, could we capture that as 275-H(1)?

*THE COURT:* Yes.

/(Peo's 275-H(1) for id = photograph)/

//*MR. HARMON:* Now, did anything happen in the course of your testing
on all the samples that you have tested in this case that undermines
your confidence in the results that both you and Mr. Sims have been
presenting?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. HARMON:* And as I mentioned, there are a number of other films that
have not been shown to the jury?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct.

*MR. HARMON:* Okay. Thanks, Miss Montgomery. I have no further
questions, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* All right. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to take a
brief recess to recycle the exhibits and allow Mr. Blasier some
opportunity to look at some items. I will ask you just to step back into
the jury room and we will buzz you out in probably about ten or fifteen
minutes. All right. Thank you.

/(Recess.)/

/(The following proceedings were held in open court, out of the presence
of the jury:)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Back on the record. All parties are again
present. Counsel, anything we need to take up before we have the jurors
rejoin us?

*MR. HARMON:* Yes, your Honor. The Defense has just provided us with
some things that they would like to use on cross-examination.

*THE COURT:* All right. I have what appears to be a color print of this.
Mr. Harmon, do you have any particulars--I mean some of these are just
demonstrative clip art.

*MR. HARMON:* Selectively demonstrative, which I think we have typically
called argumentative, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* All right. How about the summary of results chart?

*MR. HARMON:* Well, 23 total stains tested, that is accurate. 16 stains
show carry-over. I haven't heard anybody--

*THE COURT:* What does that indicate, Mr. Blasier?

*MR. BLASIER:* Mixtures.

*MR. HARMON:* Well--

*THE COURT:* All right. And no matches to the Defendant.

*MR. HARMON:* Well, the carry-over means something kind of sinister in
this case.

*MR. BLASIER:* Change it to mixtures. That is real easy.

*THE COURT:* We talked about carry-over contamination in the context of
Mr. Scheck's cross-examination so that would carry an implication as not
accurate in this context.

*MR. HARMON:* I think the no matches to the Defendant is argumentative.
They either do or they don't, and I mean if we take the--the rationale
that they forced us to try to put things on our result boards, why don't
we put who they could be from then. I think that would be fair and
consistent, your Honor, to put what it is, not what it is not, because
they--

*THE COURT:* Then what do you suggest?

*MR. HARMON:* Well, that is where it gets a little convoluted because
there are all sorts of mixture or single stains. To say what it is not
doesn't mean anything. To say what it is provides the proper context for
it. I can go down the list if you like.

*THE COURT:* It is your record, counsel.

*MR. HARMON:* I think it is argumentative to say that there are no
matches, or however they want to describe it, because that ignores what
it is. They can clearly say that in argument, but this is not the point
to start reaching your argument, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* Well, let me ask you a question: Is this dealing just with
the clothing?

*MR. BLASIER:* Just the clothing, yes.

*THE COURT:* Just the clothing.

*MR. BLASIER:* We can change that to "O.J.S. excluded." I mean this is
from their test results.

*MR. HARMON:* Well, I thought--I thought this wasn't the time for
argument in your exhibits. I mean, that is what the Court has
consistently ruled.

*THE COURT:* Yes.

*MR. HARMON:* When we had to modified almost every one of our boards and
a statement is a statement, and argument about what it is not is an
argument.

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* This is their results. He is excluded from all the
stains on the clothing. That is all it says.

*THE COURT:* Do you agree with that? With regard to the clothing, not
the glove; the clothing.

*MR. HARMON:* Sure. But how you say it--we have results. The results say
who they could be from.

/(Discussion held off the record between the Deputy District Attorneys.)/

//*MR. HARMON:* I am assuming this is in the context of the series of
slides, it is the last slide and it is the summary of the sum total of
stains that were tested, but it is still argumentative. That is in fact
the final outcome of this process, but to say--

*THE COURT:* All right. Mr. Blasier, I'm going to direct you to add
summary of results re clothing, victim's clothing, that the term
"Carry-over" be changed to mixture, "Mixtures," plural, and you can put
"Defendant excluded."

*MR. BLASIER:* I can.

*THE COURT:* Yes. All right. With regards to the D1S80 results
Rockingham glove, Mr. Harmon, do you have any objections to this?

*MR. HARMON:* It is going to be worded--that is supposed to point out
where the stains are? You see, since this is in a sequence of slides, it
is hard to appreciate--

*THE COURT:* Uh-huh.

*MR. HARMON:* --what it is supposed to demonstrate. Would you like--

*THE COURT:* All right. My concern, Mr. Blasier, is with the second
glove slide, where you have "No genotypes consistent with O.J.S.," and
that does not appear to be correct from the evidence that is here.

*MR. BLASIER:* I think the only stain that has alleles consistent with
Mr. Simpson are in the wrist area, those three, G10, 11 and 13. They are
mixtures consistent with Mr. Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson--

*THE COURT:* Uh-huh.

*MR. BLASIER:* --in the body of the glove, but nothing consistent with
Mr. Simpson.

*THE COURT:* Is the idea that you are trying to convey here that the
wrist area is the only area that you have something consistent with and
for remainder of the glove it is not consistent?

*MR. BLASIER:* Correct. All the tests done on the rest of the glove he
is excluded.

/(Discussion held off the record between the Deputy District Attorneys.)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Any other comment?

*MR. HARMON:* Well, it would be nice if we had overnight to look at
these so we don't have to struggle with them now, your Honor.

*MR. BLASIER:* Cross-examination.

*MR. HARMON:* I know it is cross-examination, but he had them yesterday.
I mean, we could avoid this stuff, so--you know, this says it all. This
is a photograph of the gloves. One of them is on the inside and the
others are on the outside and this just has a circle around the cuff of
the glove, your Honor.

*MR. BLASIER:* That is as simple as I could make it. Every time I put
more stuff on that I get objected to.

*MR. HARMON:* It may be simple, but it is not accurate. Sometimes they
deviate.

*MR. BLASIER:* How is it inaccurate?

/(Discussion held off the record between the Deputy District Attorneys.)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Mr. Harris, can you make these corrections?

*MR. HARRIS:* Yes, your Honor, right now.

*THE COURT:* All right.

*MR. BLASIER:* On the last slide, rather than "Defendant excluded" can
we say "O.J.S. excluded"?

*THE COURT:* Yes.

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MR. HARMON:* I mean it is just one side of the glove, your Honor.
There is two sides to it.

*THE COURT:* I understand.

/(Discussion held off the record between the Deputy District Attorneys.)/

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Any other comment?

/(Discussion held off the record between the Deputy District Attorneys.)/

//*THE COURT:* Mr. Harmon?

*MR. HARMON:* Just that it oversimplifies something and it is
misleading. We have actual photographs of it that actually depict where
they are. And to force somebody to say, yeah, that is right when it is
not, I don't think we do anybody a service with that.

*THE COURT:* All right. All right. With the corrections ordered by the
Court, the other objections will be overruled.

*MR. BLASIER:* Thank you, your Honor.

*MR. COCHRAN:* Thank you, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* All right. Let's have the jurors, please.

/(Brief pause.)/

/(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury:)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Please be
seated. Miss Montgomery, would you please resume the witness stand.

*MR. HARMON:* Your Honor, we had two additional films that should be
included in the--

*THE COURT:* Hold on just a second.

*MR. HARMON:* Sorry.

*THE COURT:* Good morning again, Miss Montgomery. You are reminded you
are still under oath. And Mr. Harmon I'm sorry, I thought you had
completed your direct examination.

*MR. HARMON:* We noticed there were two additional films so we should go
up to t then, 275-T.

*THE COURT:* All right. 275-T. Mrs. Robertson do you have that?

/(Peo's 275-S & 275-T for id = film)/

//*THE COURT:* Good morning, Mr. Blasier.

*MR. BLASIER:* Good morning, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* You may commence your cross-examination.

_C*ROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER*_

__*MR. BLASIER:* Miss Montgomery, good morning.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Good morning, Mr. Blasier.

*MR. BLASIER:* Good morning.

*THE JURY: *Good morning.

*MR. BLASIER:* Miss Montgomery, when Mr. Harmon was asking you questions
about various stains, he was describing the locations where those stains
were purportedly obtained from. Do you remember that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, you have no personal knowledge if those descriptions
were accurate, do you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. As I stated, I--Mr. Sims looked at the samples
that came into the lab and then I did the analysis for D1S80.

*MR. BLASIER:* Of course he doesn't have any personal knowledge either,
does he? He was not out at the scene collecting evidence?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, he was not.

*MR. BLASIER:* And nobody from the Department of Justice to your
knowledge was out there actually collecting and preserving evidence,
correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And so you have no way of personally verifying that the
evidence was collected properly or processed properly before it came to
your lab; is that correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I was not at the crime scene, no.

*MR. BLASIER:* So basically you take what is sent to you and you can
account for what happens once you get it, but you can't really say a
whole lot about what might have happened to it before?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. I want to ask you a couple of questions about your
notes. Your notes were provided to us in discovery, were they not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, they were.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, you write your notes in ink?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I do.

*MR. BLASIER:* And all of your pages are numbered sequentially, are they
not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, they are.

*MR. BLASIER:* You number those as you go along, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I do.

*MR. BLASIER:* And when you are done with a block of pages, you go back
and actually put page 2 of 70, page 3 of 70, page 4 of 70, do you not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, when I go back, since I number them at the time
I'm making the notes, what I do is I go back and I count how many total
pages. You know, in this case there was over a hundred pages just for my
analysis, and so I will just write "Of" or "Slash" with the total on the
bottom.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that is so that you can ensure in your own mind that
you are accounting for all of your work papers, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And anybody else that is looking at your work papers can
tell how many pages there are supposed to be, how many pages there are?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right.

*MR. BLASIER:* And your handwriting is pretty easy to read, is it not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I find it easy to read.

*MR. BLASIER:* When you make a correction, you don't erase anything, you
line it out, you put your initials on it, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that is all standard laboratory procedures at the
Department of Justice, is it not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it is.

*MR. BLASIER:* Those are just good techniques that you have learned as a
criminalist, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, actually I learned them prior to being a
criminalist, yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* And in fact you don't even leave any space at the bottom
of a page, you draw a box or an "X" if you finished something and there
is still room on the page, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I like to try to do that. There are occasions when I
don't. It is just to let me know that nothing else has been written on
that page at that time.

*MR. BLASIER:* And is it accurate to say that one of the reasons for all
of these safeguards that you use is so nobody can come in and change
your notes or add something without you knowing about it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, no. I think it is more for--first of all, the
numbering is so I know how many pages there are and the order of my
notes and also then when I get into court, so I can easily refer to a
certain page and see the sequence of events, and as far as crossing out,
it is just so I am aware that nothing else was written on that page that
day and just ending the page.

*MR. BLASIER:* Is it accurate that one of the ideas of doing your notes
as thoroughly as you do is that at some point in the future when you may
get called to court you want to be able to sit down and reconstruct
everything important that you did on a particular case?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* And furthermore, another important reason for doing it
that way is that if for some reason you had changed employment or
changed professions or something like that, another analyst could sit
down with your notes and basically reconstruct everything you did on a
particular test?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you agree that it is not good procedure for you, if
you get called into court, to have to say you don't remember something
because you didn't write it down?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, it depends on what that is.

*MR. BLASIER:* Any important steps that you do in a particular test, if
you say I don't remember because I didn't write it down, that is not
very effective on your part, isn't it?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection, it is irrelevant.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* Miss Montgomery, I want to ask you just a few questions
about your background. Mr. Harmon asked you about undergraduate courses
that related to DNA and I didn't think you said any. Was I accurate in that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. I think I jumped right into post-graduation
courses. I didn't discuss the courses that I took as an undergraduate,
but some of those courses were biochemistry in which DNA was discussed.
Also in my environmental toxicology courses DNA was discussed in several
of those courses.

*MR. BLASIER:* In what context?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* In the context of, umm, like mode of action, how
chemicals reacted on humans or animals, and so it was discussed on how
the DNA was affected by certain chemicals in the environment or that
were produced by chemical companies.

*MR. BLASIER:* Did anything in your undergraduate background cover
forensic applications of DNA technology?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, you indicated in--now, did any of your graduate
courses involve forensic applications of DNA technology?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, as far as graduate courses, there was
only--well, actually two of the courses I took post graduation I
received graduate units for. The others were under--upper division
courses but not graduate courses. And the ones that I obtained graduate
units were the FBI academy class, through the University of Virginia,
and that was six units of graduate course and that was the forensic
application of DNA technology and also the laboratory course. And then
also one unit of graduate--one unit of graduate level units was given in
the DNA sequencing course through the University of Northern Colorado.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, your genetics course in 1992 at Cal State Hayward,
that didn't deal with forensic applications of DNA technology, did it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. BLASIER:* Umm, how about your two semesters in molecular biology at
Berkeley, `92 and `93, did that deal with forensic applications of DNA
technology at all?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm not quite sure if it went over--the instructor of
the course had an interest in forensics and application of DNA
technology to forensics, but I don't recall if he actually had a lecture
on it or not.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, that particular course, I think you indicated that
there was no hands-on work in that course?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Your training at Quantico, did that involve any study or
applications or case work dealing with D1S80?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I believe they talked about AMP-FLPS, the amplified
fragment length polymorphisms, in the PCR section, but the course was
not devoted to D1S80 analysis, but they did talk about the PCR technique.

*MR. BLASIER:* But specifically it related to D1S80. That wasn't really
a focus of that course, was it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It was not the focus of the course.

*MR. BLASIER:* Did you have any hands-on work at all at the Quantico course?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I had hands-on.

*MR. BLASIER:* Any involving D1S80?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. BLASIER:* Any involving DQ-Alpha?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* And how much hands-on work did you have there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Half of the course was devoted to the laboratory
aspect of DNA analysis and the other half was devoted to lectures, so,
oh, approximately two weeks, maybe a little less than two weeks in total
of that four weeks was devoted to the laboratory aspect of DNA analysis.

*MR. BLASIER:* And approximately how many individual tests did you do at
that time, just approximately?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Oh, I don't recall.

*MR. BLASIER:* More than three?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I can't imagine it was more than three.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, your statistics course in the fall of `93 at
Berkeley, did that have anything to do with the forensic applications of
DNA technology?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, but that instructor was also interested in the
application of forensics and how statistics was applied to forensic
issues and so he would discuss in passing just some of the forensic
applications and how statistics related to that.

*MR. BLASIER:* And how about your course in DNA sequencing in the summer
of `94 at the University of Colorado, was this dealing with forensic
applications of DNA technology?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, the instructor of that course was Dr. Steve Lee
and he is a researcher at our laboratory and so he did discuss forensic
applications, but the focus of the class was DNA sequencing, just in
general.

*MR. BLASIER:* Is it fair to say that--that all of your background, with
the exception of the Quantico training course and what you have talked
about with the California criminalistics institute, didn't really focus
on forensic applications of DNA technology to any great extent?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* My classroom--my formal classroom training?

*MR. BLASIER:* And these courses that we have talked about in Colorado,
Berkeley?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. As far as the formal classroom training, the
credited or I guess I should say credited, not formal, those involve
just the theory, but then the courses that I took that weren't credited,
such as the course through the California Criminalistic Institute on
PCR, that was devoted to DNA analysis and its forensic aspects.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, you listed some of the courses that you took under
general criminalistics, and I wrote those down as basic microscopy, zone
electrophoresis, sexual assault, low explosives, clandestine labs, arson
investigations and basic serology. Was that--that is a pretty complete list?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. I--I believe that is the extent.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you agree that all of those, with the exception of
perhaps zone electrophoresis, deal with things other than forensic
applications of DNA technology?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And your 1989 course in crime scene investigations that
you took in eureka, did that have anything to do with DNA technology?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, it was a crime scene investigation course, so
reconstruction and collection of evidence.

*MR. BLASIER:* I'm sorry?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm done.

*MR. BLASIER:* And your firearms safety course in `89, that didn't have
anything to do with DNA, did it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. BLASIER:* Do you have any publications that deal with DNA technology?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I don't.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, when you went to work at Modesto in 1988, that was
an--that was an arm of the Department of Justice?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. Modesto is a satellite laboratory, it is a full
service criminalistic laboratory.

*MR. BLASIER:* And you were there for three years?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right.

*MR. BLASIER:* Did you do anything relating to forensic applications of
DNA technology during that three years?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, not hands-on. At that time I was interested in
DNA--the use of DNA in forensics and so I would keep up-to-date on what
was going on in the DNA field.

*MR. BLASIER:* But you had no practical experience at all?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, when you went to Stockton in 1991, again you were
doing things other than DNA--forensic applications of DNA technology,
correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* So that didn't provide you with any relevant experience
to what you are doing now?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(No audible response.)/

*MR. BLASIER:* Relative--

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, as far as DNA analysis, that's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. Now, finally, in 1992 you moved to the DNA lab in
Berkeley?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right.

*MR. BLASIER:* When you moved there, did you go there with the intention
of working in forensic DNA technology areas?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I did. The field was changing from conventional
serology to DNA analysis, and since I was very interested in DNA
analysis from early on, I decided the best place to gain more experience
and to actually work with the technology was at the Berkeley laboratory.

*MR. BLASIER:* And at what point did you get assigned--you were put in
charge of setting up the D1S80 program?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Two individuals; myself and Richard Showalter
were--worked together in the development of a system, the D1S80 system.

*MR. BLASIER:* And had--when was that about, approximately?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That was--I believe Richard started it in June--the
summer of `94, so I think he began around June with the technique and
then when I got back from the FBI academy I worked with him and we
worked together in the development of that system.

*MR. BLASIER:* When you were assigned that responsibility, had you ever
done a D1S80 test?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Done a--

*MR. BLASIER:* D1S80 test?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I had not.

*MR. BLASIER:* Your Honor, perhaps this might be a good time.

*THE COURT:* All right. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to take our
break for the lunch recess. Please remember all my admonitions to you.
Don't discuss the case among yourselves, don't form any opinions about
the case, don't conduct any deliberations until the matter has been
submitted to you, do not allow anybody to communicate with you with
regard to the case. We will stand in recess until 1:00 P.M. all right.
Miss Montgomery, you may step down. You are ordered to return at 1:00 P.M.

/(At 12:04 P.M. the noon recess was taken until 1:00 P.M. of the same day.)/

//*LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; TUESDAY, MAY 23, 1995 1:00 P.M.*

**Department no. 103 Hon. Lance A. Ito, Judge

*APPEARANCES:* (Appearances as heretofore noted.)

(Janet M. Moxham, CSR no. 4855, official reporter.)

(Christine M. Olson, CSR no. 2378, official reporter.)

/(The following proceedings were held in open court, out of the presence
of the jury:)/

//*THE COURT:* Back on the record in the Simpson case. All parties are
again present. All right. Miss Montgomery is with us. Mr. Blasier, we
are ready to proceed?

*MR. BLASIER:* Yes, your Honor.

*MR. SCHECK:* Just one note. The next witness, who I hope will be coming
up soon, Mr. Yamauchi, they just showed us some boards, and I also have
some objections to putting in typing results where there's no C dot or
inconclusive, and I wanted to make a time with the Court maybe at the
end of the day or whenever we could take up these matters.

*THE COURT:* I have the feeling we're going to finish with Miss
Montgomery today.

*MR. SCHECK:* Yes, we should. That's why I was hoping we could take up
those other matters and perhaps we can finish up all these witnesses
this week.

*THE COURT:* Good. Let's have the jurors, please.

/(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury:)/

//*THE COURT:* Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Please be seated. The
record should reflect that we've now been rejoined by all the members of
our jury panel. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

*THE JURY: *Good afternoon. All right. Miss Montgomery, would you resume
the witness stand, please.

/Renee Montgomery, the witness on the stand at the time of the lunch
recess, resumed the stand and testified further as follows:/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Good afternoon, Miss Montgomery.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Good afternoon.

*THE COURT:* You are reminded, ma'am, you are still under oath. And, Mr.
Blasier, you may continue with your cross-examination.

*MR. BLASIER:* Thank you, your Honor. Good afternoon, folks.

*THE JURY: *Good afternoon.

_C*ROSS-EXAMINATION *(R*ESUMED) BY MR. BLASIER*_

__*MR. BLASIER:* Miss Montgomery.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Mr. Blasier.

*MR. BLASIER:* When we broke for lunch, we were talking about your level
of experience with the D1S80 system. When the program started at DOJ,
was there anyone at DOJ that had any experience at all with D1S80?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. Dr. Nora Rudin had looked at some of the gel
systems, I believe it was back in 1990, and that was for a brief period.
And at that time, our lab decided to focus on other things. And so the
project was dropped. She--Dr. Nora Rudin was a researcher at our laboratory.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that's the extent of the experience of everybody in
your lab with D1S80 prior to when you started--when you were in charge
of the program, setting it up?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, the period of time from when you started to set up
this program until it was actually implemented in casework was eight months?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it was. We started in--well, actually, it was a
little over eight months. We started, like I said, in June of `94 and
then began casework in April--or June of `93 and then began casework in
April of `94.

*MR. BLASIER:* Is there any requirement at all that a new marker system
such as D1S80 or a new technique have any kind of government approval at
all to assure that it's a valid system?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Government approval?

*MR. BLASIER:* Yes.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, but there are guidelines that are set up that must
be met. And some of these are--well, actually these guidelines are
addressed under Twgdam, and Twgdam's a technical working group on DNA
analysis and methods. And they set up criteria that must be addressed--

*THE COURT:* Excuse me. Miss Montgomery, the actual question was
regarding government.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay.

*MR. BLASIER:* There is no government approval process required at all,
is there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, there's not.

*MR. BLASIER:* And you're aware that with clinical testing involving new
DNA techniques, they require extensive governmental regulation and
approval by the FDA?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. It's irrelevant, insufficient foundation.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* But there's no such approval process like that required
for a new system such as D1S80?

*MR. HARMON:* "No such approval" is vague, no foundation.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* You indicated Twgdam, that there are guidelines that you
must follow. Twgdam is a voluntary program, isn't it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I believe--well, in our laboratory, it's not a
voluntary program. It's something that must be followed--the guidelines
have to be followed, first of all, for accreditation purposes and also
because our laboratory believes in these--in Twgdam guidelines.

*MR. BLASIER:* There's no enforcement mechanism, however, is there, if
you don't follow the guidelines? Are you aware of any?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm not aware of any.

*MR. BLASIER:* And Twgdam is a voluntary--you can run your lab without
complying with Twgdam, can't you?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. Argumentative, your Honor.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm not quite sure.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MR. BLASIER:* So you're not sure whether Twgdam is mandatory or not in
terms of you being governed by someone other than yourselves?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I'm not.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, the D1S80 system is really the newest system
compared to DQ-Alpha, polymarkers and RFLP; is it not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, compared to those three, yes. But there are
other techniques that are being looked at at this time.

*MR. BLASIER:* There are other techniques that are even newer than
D1S80, aren't there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm sorry. Not techniques. I mean markers, because the
technique in general is a PCR technique. But it's actually the marker
that's--that's the new part of it.

*MR. BLASIER:* Well, but this is--you described it as a marriage between
RFLP and PCR. It's a different system than just PCR and just RFLP, isn't it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct. It's incorporating the two techniques into one.

*MR. BLASIER:* And just as it might have the strengths of both systems,
it also has the weaknesses of both systems put together?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. No foundation, assumes facts not in evidence.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* Any indication that it works any better than PCR,
DQ-Alpha or any better than RFLP?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, I believe that all three of these systems are
equally reliable and can give reproducible results. I don't see any of
them as being better than the other as far as obtaining results. The
difference is, as Dr. Cotton and Mr. Sims stated, is with the RFLP, that
you can--you need larger amounts of samples and et cetera.

*MR. BLASIER:* You're aware of the areas of PCR technology where there
can be problems such as contamination; are you not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. We're always concerned with contamination.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that applies with D1S80; does it not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it does.

*MR. BLASIER:* Because it is a PCR process, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* So it has all of the potential problems that DQ-Alpha
testing has; does it not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct. As far as sensitivity and contamination, yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, with respect to the RFLP half of it, does it have
some of the limitations that RFLP has with respect to the size of a
sample that you need?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, it doesn't. And I guess I need to clarify how I
meant by incorporating both RFLP and PCR. By incorporating the RFLP, you
know, by the marriagement, it's the--we're looking at these repetitive
sequences. And so just to clarify that issue, that's how it's similar to
the RFLP process. As far as your question, you--I'm sorry. Could you
restate your question?

*MR. BLASIER:* I think you answered it. Now, as being responsible for
setting up this program, you're required or responsible for reviewing
all of the relevant literature pertaining to D1S80; are you not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. I reviewed the literature.

*MR. BLASIER:* And did you spend a considerable amount of time doing
that to make sure that you understood the technology?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* And do you still keep up with that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I do.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you agree with--that with respect to D1S80, there's
much, much less literature on it than there is, for instance, RFLP?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, that's true.

*MR. BLASIER:* And there's much, much less literature than there is with
PCR, DQ-Alpha, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* It has been used in casework much less than PCR, DQ-Alpha
and RFLP, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. DQ-Alpha's been around since 1986 or so.

*MR. BLASIER:* And during the course of your work at DOJ, you've only
worked on 20 cases I believe. Is that what you said approximately?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. Approximately 20 cases. Each case involves more
than just one sample though.

*MR. BLASIER:* And how many cases does your lab approximately handle in
a year?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Hmm.

*THE COURT:* Counsel, you want to--are you talking DNA cases?

*MR. BLASIER:* DNA cases.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, our laboratory's not known for quick turn-around
time. We tend to be a bit slow at doing cases. So each analyst does
approximately two cases a month. That's what we strive for. And in our
lab currently, we only have four, I'd say four and a half individuals
doing cases. So in the past year, I--this would just be a guess, but,
you know, let's say probably around--

*MR. BLASIER:* A hundred?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* --80 to a hundred cases.

*MR. BLASIER:* And so the--in the 20 cases that you've worked on, does
that--is that all of the D1S80 cases?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, it's not.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would it be fair to say that the D1S80 cases are a
relatively small percentage of the total cases that DOJ handles with DNA
testing?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, anytime there's a small amount of sample, both
the DQ-Alpha and the D1S80 system would be used unless the individual is
excluded on one of the systems. Then the other system wouldn't be used
at that time. So anytime we have the capability of using both systems,
both systems will be used. If it's an RFLP case, then typically we only
do the RFLP and we don't do the PCR typing.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, cellmark doesn't do D1S80, do they?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, they don't.

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Now, as of August of last year, had Department of
Justice reported or testified about any D1S80 results in any case anywhere?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* How many approximately?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, I know of one case, and that's the case that I
did in I believe it was the summer of last year in `94. I don't recall
if any other cases were--if any of the other analysts have testified to
D1S80--

*MR. BLASIER:* So all you can recall--

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* --at this time.

*MR. BLASIER:* I'm sorry?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* And so at this time, all I can recall is the one case
that I've done.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, you were asked some questions about proficiency
testing, and I think you indicated that you had been involved in five
proficiency tests?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* All D1S80?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Actually if I can review a document--

*MR. BLASIER:* Sure.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* --answer that for you.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MS. MONTGOMERY:* And I believe this is the document that you've
obtained on discovery.

*MR. BLASIER:* And how many of those proficiency tests involve D1S80?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Four of the five involve D1S80.

*MR. BLASIER:* And you indicated that you got those all right?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And what does that mean? Does that mean that you got the
type that was expected that you'd get?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. That means that the results that were reported
out by the laboratory were the expected results.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, are these blind tests? Do you know you're being tested?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, we know we're being tested.

*MR. BLASIER:* And who prepares the samples?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Prepares them for--to send out to our laboratory?

*MR. BLASIER:* Yeah. Are those prepared in-house?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. These proficiencies are prepared externally. We
subscribe to two systems. One is CTS and another one is cellmark, and we
also have in-house proficiencies that have to be done too.

*MR. BLASIER:* But these far are--the four that related to D1S80, were
they externally provided or internally provided?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. These were internally provided.

*MR. BLASIER:* But you knew you were being tested?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Did you know what the results were supposed to be?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I didn't.

*MR. BLASIER:* Let me show you--

*MR. HARMON:* Could we approach on this, your Honor?

*THE COURT:* All right. With the court reporter.

/(The following proceedings were held at the bench:)/

//*THE COURT:* We're over at sidebar. Mr. Harmon.

*MR. HARMON:* This is kind of where we're going to go with Mr. Yamauchi
too. These proficiency tests, I think there's a 352 problem. I don't
know if there's an offer of proof or if he just wants to go over the
whole proficiency test. I understand from the Defense consultants the
spin they want to put on these things, but they're either right or
they're wrong, and I just wanted to alert you that we're going to spend
an inordinate amount of time over the next two weeks if you allow them
to go into every proficiency test without a specific offer of proof. I'm
saying it's irrelevant I guess is the legal objection.

*MR. BLASIER:* I'm just going into one. The reason it's relevant is
because they didn't get the right results. There's an allele there
that's not supposed to be there. They're stating the result they got is
right. In my view, it's misleading. This shows that, and that's the only
one I'm going to cover.

*THE COURT:* All right. Objection overruled.

/(The following proceedings were held in open court:)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Thank you, counsel.

*MR. BLASIER:* Miss Montgomery, let me show you two pages of discovery,
page 803, and ask if you recognize these as work sheets on a proficiency
test that you did.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I do.

*MR. BLASIER:* And those are--that's just one proficiency test, is it
not, that's--that was rehybridized twice or a second time?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. This is one proficiency test.

*MR. BLASIER:* So you're testing the same samples in both, both of those
work sheets?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* But you're doing a different hybridization? Those
represent two different hybridizations?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. And there are some different samples.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay.

*MR. BLASIER:* Your Honor, I would like to have these marked.

*THE COURT:* Mrs. Robertson. 1172.

*MR. BLASIER:* 1172-A and B or--

*THE COURT:* Yeah. A and B.

/(Deft's 1172-A and B for id = work sheets)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* I would like to put 1172-A on the elmo first.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Miss Montgomery, the two pages I showed you, one was
numbered page 6 of 9 and the other was page 8 of 9. Do you recall that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'd have to look at it again.

*MR. BLASIER:* And I want you to tell me which one of these you did first.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, actually, that's not my writing at the top of
the page. My writing's at the bottom and I can not tell the whole--it
hasn't been Xeroxed completely.

*MR. BLASIER:* Can you tell from your own notes?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, this is a proficiency. This isn't something that
I brought to court with me today.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* But it appears that one says 14 of 22 and the other
says 19 of and there's a 2. So--if I could see the original documents or
a better copy, that would be even better. But just by looking at it, it
appears that the 14 of 22, the other one's trying to say 19 of 22 maybe.

*MR. BLASIER:* Let me show you the rest of the document that those pages
came from and see if that helps you.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yeah. It--it appears that this is--this second page is
probably part of the same document. It has the same proficiency number
and also has a date two days later. So this is the first one that has a
date of the 18th of October and the second one would be the 20th of October.

*MR. BLASIER:* All right. For the record, she's referring to 1172-A as
the first one and 1172-B as the second one.

*THE COURT:* Thank you.

*MR. BLASIER:* Let's look at 1172-A. Let me give you the rest of this
packet in case you need to refer to it.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* And do you also have the original or a copy of the
photos that go with these?

*MR. BLASIER:* I don't believe we do. Now, this is the work sheet--what
we have up on the elmo is the work sheet that describes what results you
saw after you performed the test, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yeah. This multi media, I can't decide what to look at.

*MR. BLASIER:* Whatever's easiest.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* The clarity is not very good on this. So maybe if I
came down there, it would be easier for me to see.

*MR. BLASIER:* Sure.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay.

*MR. BLASIER:* Can we pull it in a little bit to the 432-51? Right
there. That's good.

*MR. BLASIER:* 432-51, that line refers to one of the samples that was
provided in the proficiency test, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Actually that's dash S. That's an S.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. And that's one of the samples you were supposed to
type and get a result, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And QC839 in the middle of the screen there toward the
bottom, what's that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's a quality control. What would be more helpful
is if I had the whole file on this. It's difficult just to take this all
out of context to actually see what the notes are prior to the samples
being written on here because a lot of times, what you want to do--when
you talk about sample, you can't write everything that pertains to that
particular sample. So you write a certain section in that sample, and
then in your actual--the body of your notes, you write a little more
description.

*MR. BLASIER:* What you write in the little boxes there is what you see
on the dots. Or I'm sorry--

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm sorry. I'm talking about--

*MR. BLASIER:* I'm sorry.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm talking about the sample lane.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. Now, this is actually a DQ-Alpha proficiency test,
correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And what you write in the boxes there is what you see on
the dots, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct. Now, you're over to the dots.

*MR. BLASIER:* Yeah. On QC839, do you see where it says there's a hint
of a 1.3?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I see that.

*MR. BLASIER:* That's not the correct result for QC839, is it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. That must be the correct result because this goes
through approval. We have this approval process where, first of all, a
second reader reads the strips and then the results are given to a
supervisor to review the whole case, and the QCs are unknown to us and
the supervisor reviews the results of your QC. And if you--and they
check to make sure those QCs are giving the proper results. If the QC
doesn't give the proper results, then something needs to be done.

*MR. BLASIER:* The box under "Type," that's the type of that quality
control sample; is it not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that's indicated as a 1.1, 3, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right.

*MR. BLASIER:* Nothing in there about a 1.3, is there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Oh, no, because that's a hint. It's--

*MR. BLASIER:* What's the diff--what's a hint?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* A hint is just an indication of some--I believe Gary
Sims talked to you yesterday or the day--or a couple days ago about
this. When you look at the DQ-Alpha strips where there are a series of
the dots and next to the 1.3 in this case, if I document--if I wrote
that that's a hint, then there was some outline or a hint of some
activity seen at that dot. But it was significantly less than the C dot.
So it was--it had to be documented, but it wasn't significant to the
analysis. When--in our laboratories, things need to be C or greater
before they're actually called.

*MR. BLASIER:* If this were a mixture, however, you interpret mixtures
where you have dots less than the C dots as being alleles, don't you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Dots less than the C dot?

*MR. BLASIER:* Yes.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* If you see a C dot, then that would--you do report
that out. As far as a C minus or a trace or a hint, you note it, but as
far as any interpretation, one needs to be cautious about interpretation
on that.

*MR. BLASIER:* You're not supposed to see anything at the 1.3 dot with a
quality control sample that's a 1.1, 3, are you?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. That's argumentative, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* Sustained. Rephrase the question.

*MR. BLASIER:* Are you supposed to see anything in the 1.3 dot with the
quality control sample that it's a 1.1 and a 3?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, if you--you shouldn't see a substantial amount
of activity at that 1.3 if that's truly--if that is a 1.1, 3. It's one
of the limitations of the system; at the 1.3, you could get
cross-hybridization. And this is where sequence that's complimentary or
to the 1.3 will actually cause some hybriding--or cause some of the 1.3
dot to show up. But this is just an artifact of the system and at such a
low level, one wouldn't even interpret that result.

*MR. BLASIER:* So you can get 1.3 dots when there's nothing there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* When there's--

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. Vague as to "Dots," argumentative.

*MR. BLASIER:* When there's--

*MR. BLASIER:* Let me rephrase it.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MR. BLASIER:* You can get a 1.3 dot when there's no DNA there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It's not a dot that would be interpretable. As I
stated, that's--that's a hint. It's not a C dot. The intensity is
substantially less than that C, the C dot.

*MR. BLASIER:* What's the difference between a hint and a trace?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* We have a--in our laboratory, we have a scale of
progression on how to call these dots. An outline hint means there's
a--you can see something on the strip, but it's just a small amount. A
trace is a little more and then there's a C minus and then a C and then
a C plus.

*MR. BLASIER:* What's a trace? Is a trace an indication of some DNA there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* A trace is a little more than a hint, but once again,
it's not significant for the analysis. It just happens to be an artifact
or a limitation of the sys--or not a limitation. An artifact of the
system. A trace would not be interpreted in the results.

*MR. BLASIER:* What's the difference between a system that gives you
artifacts and a system that has limitations that gives you an artifact?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. That's argumentative, compound.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, you indicated it wasn't a limitation of the system?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right.

*MR. BLASIER:* Whose fault is it that you get dots at 1.3 when there's
no DNA there?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. That's argumentative.

*THE COURT:* Sustained. Rephrase the question.

*MR. BLASIER:* Are the 1.3 dots caused by limitations in the system or
something else?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, it's caused by a little of both. And what
happens--you know, these are not significant dots. They're hints and
traces. They aren't--they would not be counted in your interpretation.
But what happens is, if a--with slight variations in the typing, some
trace amounts of 1.3 activity can be seen on the strips. And it's--I
guess one could say it's a limitation as Mr. Blasier says, but also it's
an artifact of the system. And if it was something--these dots are so
faint and so weak that, you know, as I have said, it just wouldn't be
counted in your interpretation.

*MR. BLASIER:* It could also be a minor component of a mixture that has
a 1.3 and a small quantity in it, couldn't it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It could be, but it wouldn't be interpreted at that level.

*MR. BLASIER:* And is there some sort of uniform scale within the
forensic community by which you determine the difference between a hint
and a trace?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. BLASIER:* Does it have anything to do with the results that you
expect to get out of a test as to whether you're going to call it a hint
or a trace or a C minus?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. That's argumentative.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, the positive control, the lane second from the
bottom, that was supposed to be a 1.1, 4, correct? That's what the type
was that was put in that lane, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That is a 1.1, 4.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, you got a trace of a 1.3 in that lane, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that's more than the hint in the quality control sample?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it is. As I said, on our scale of progression, a
trace is slightly greater than a hint.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, are you supposed to get these kinds of traces and
hints when you perform tests? Are they expected?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, they're not.

*MR. BLASIER:* So this is an unexpected result; is it not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* This is something that you--it's not unexpected. I
think "Unexpected" is a bad word to use with it. It's something--as I
said, it's just an artifact of the system, and by doing reanalysis, you
could probably get rid of those hints and traces.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. Let's talk about the reanalysis which is the page
2, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* This is 1172-B. Now, you did this one again, the one we
just looked at, and the sheet that's on the elmo is the results of the
second run or second hybridization on the same samples; is that correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. Some of the samples are the same.

*MR. BLASIER:* Why did you run it the second time?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'd have to see the notes to know why.

*MR. BLASIER:* Is there anything in that packet there that tells you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. BLASIER:* Well, what--ordinarily, what would be your reason for
running a proficiency test a second time?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* There could be various reasons. I think I'd need to
see the actual--my actual notes to be able to explain why I reran this a
second time.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would one reason be the hints and the traces that you got
the first time?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. Calls for speculation.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* If the results that you got on the first one were totally
as expected, would you have any reason to run it a second time?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. Calls for speculation.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, that's possible. You know, I would--I would need
to see the actual--to speculate on this or it's best not to speculate.
It's best to actually see my notes in this particular instance.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. Now, these are your notes with respect to how you
read the strips, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, let's look at 432S1, the top lane. That's the first
one. Now, would you agree that you found that there was a hint at 1.3
and a hint at 1.1 that was unexpected?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Once again, by saying "Unexpected," I think
you're--you're putting more emphasis on it than you should. There was--I
did notice hints in both of those samples. And once again, the hint is
not significant to the results of that analysis.

*MR. BLASIER:* So these are hints that show up now in the same sample
that didn't show up the first time you did it, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Could you put the first one back up?

*MR. BLASIER:* You've got the first one in your hand.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Oh, you're right. Yes. Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* They did not show up the first time, did they?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, in 433S2, we've got a trace at 1.1 and a trace at
1.3 that don't conform to the genotype of the sample which is 1.2, 3,
correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that didn't show up the first time you did that
sample, did it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* 434S3, we now have a trace at 1.1 that is not consistent
with the type of that sample which is a 4, 4, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, quality control sample 839, we have two hints that
are inconsistent with the genotype of that quality control, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, no. They're not inconsistent with the genotype
of that quality control. I have to keep emphasizing that a hint is not
significant. A hint is just noting that something--you're seeing a
little darkening in the dot and it's not significant to your
interpretation. The results of that QC are 1.1, 3 and those were the
correct results.

*MR. BLASIER:* Isn't one of the tests of whether a system like this is a
reliable system, whether or not if you do the same samples two times,
you're supposed to get the same results, aren't you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. And as you can see in this case, the same results
were obtained.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. You can resume your seat.

/(The witness complies.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* So is it fair to say that this one particular
proficiency test that we've looked at is an example of one which has
been scored in some fashion that you got the right answers?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. The right results were obtained from that
proficiency.

*MR. BLASIER:* Who grades these?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Excuse me?

*MR. BLASIER:* Who grades these?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Grades them. The individuals review them. First of
all, my--the--a supervisor in the laboratory would review the results,
and then secondly, a--the outside agency that submitted the samples to
us would review our results and then determine--send out a result
whether we obtained the correct results or not.

*MR. BLASIER:* Do you know what a laminar flow hood is?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I do.

*MR. BLASIER:* And do you use that--performing any kind of PCR
amplification, the various steps that you perform in that test, do you
do them within a laminar flow hood?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. I do the set-up of the amplification in a laminar
flow hood.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you ever use a hood that is called a flume hood I
believe that sucks air from the outside of the lab into the area of the
hood and then out?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. Irrelevant.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* Laminar flow hood, is that something that's pretty
standard in terms of your education as a criminalist that you're taught
what that is and how to use it?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. It's irrelevant.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, it's--it's just a hood that has air flow and a
window of air that separates the inside environment from the outside
environment, and there's really not much training on it. You just turn
the switch on to activate the hood.

*MR. BLASIER:* But you're taught what a laminar flow hood is, aren't you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I don't recall being taught. It's just something that
I'm aware of, something that I'm familiar with.

*MR. BLASIER:* The kits that you use to perform DQ-Alpha and D1S80 tests
require that you do them in a laminar flow hood, don't they?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. Vague as to "Require."

*THE COURT:* Sustained. Rephrase the question.

*MR. BLASIER:* The kits that you use that are provided by Roche that
produces the kits state that various steps should be done in a laminar
flow hood?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. That's still vague, "Various steps," your Honor.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm not quite sure. I don't recall seeing that in
there. If you could show me the section.

*MR. BLASIER:* I'll get that at the break. Have any of the proficiency
tests that you've taken involved mixed bloodstains?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I don't believe so.

*MR. BLASIER:* Most of the or many of the stains that you looked at in
this case, you--your test results indicated could be mixed stains, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Some of them, yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* And so you've never undergone any kind of testing to see
whether you're able to do mixed bloodstains accurately?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. That's incorrect.

*MR. BLASIER:* What kind of testing have you undergone for that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I've--part of the validation process of the D1S80
marker, I looked at mixed--mixed samples, and these were both
mixed--they're mixed DNA's. So not actually the mixed bloodstain
together, but the DNA or an extraction process where the two DNA's were
mixed together. And I looked at that during the validation process in
use in our laboratory. And I believe that's the only--those are the
mixed bloods that were examined. There are mixed samples that are
examined also in the laboratory and this--sexual assault samples, you
know, vaginal swabs where you'll have epithelial cells and then if
there's sperm present also.

*MR. BLASIER:* But there are no proficiency tests that you've taken that
involve mixed samples of blood, are there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, you know, I was just looking at this as you were
or as I was talking, and it's--one of the proficiencies I did was blood
semen mix. And that was a cellmark proficiency. And so that's where some
of the blood and semen was mixed together. It wasn't two bloodstains,
but it was two different samples mixed together and one of them happened
to be a bloodstain.

*MR. BLASIER:* Without getting into any detail, sexual assault samples
are different than mixed blood samples, aren't they?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right. But this--correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* You have other methods that you can use, a differential
lysis to split them apart, can't you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* But you can't do it with bloodstains?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right.

*MR. BLASIER:* Incidentally, did you perform any kind of analysis on any
of the stains that you looked at under the microscope to determine
whether you could tell if there was a saliva component to any of these
mixed stains?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. As I stated earlier, Mr. Sims looked at all the
evidence initially and I did the D1S80 or DQ-Alpha analysis on the
samples after he examined the samples.

*MR. BLASIER:* So you have no way of determining whether any of the
components of the mixtures you testified to are--have saliva
contributions from a source as opposed to blood?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, I want to ask you some questions about the victims'
clothing with respect to the D1S80 results. Do you have that in mind?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. I'll--I'll pull up the notes.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Could we have slide--we need to have a number for slide
presentation.

*THE COURT:* All right. Next in order will be 1173. 1173.

/(Deft's 1173-A through I for id = slides)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* And could we have the fourth slide, which is d?

*THE COURT:* Mrs. Robertson, 1173.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Now could we have slide e?

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, Miss Montgomery, you conducted tests on three items
of clothing, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I conducted analysis on two items of clothing and
Steve Myers in our laboratory examined Nicole Simpson's dress.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. And the two items that you looked at were the shirt
and the pants of Ronald Goldman?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And the dress was looked at by Steve Myers, that was
Nicole Brown Simpson's dress?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Actually the DNA was analyzed. The items were looked
at by someone else.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. And there were certain D1S80 results that came out
of that analysis of those three items, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, I've indicated on my chart up there that I've--I
just color-coded it so it's a little easier to understand.

*MR. BLASIER:* Could we have slide F.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, would you agree that from your results, yours and
Steve Myers' results, there were six stains looked at on Nicole Brown
Simpson's dress, three of which indicated a contribution by--possibly by
Ronald Goldman?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm referring to the report at this time.

*MR. BLASIER:* Sure.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. A total of six stains were examined and three
of the stains had a weaker contribution of a 24 allele.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, could we have slide g, please.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you agree that there were nine stains examined from
Ronald Goldman's jeans, five of which had an indication of an 18 allele
which is consistent with Nicole Brown Simpson?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, four of them had a weaker 18 allele. One of them
had G6 from the left thigh area, had a possible trace 18. And that's
what I had talked about earlier, where there was a darkening on the
band, but it could not definitely be determined that it was a band.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. And can we have slide H.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you agree that there were eight stains examined
from Ronald Goldman's shirt and all eight of those stains showed an 18
allele consistent with Nicole Brown Simpson?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, could we have slide I, please.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, to summarize, there were a total of 23 stains tested
on these three items of clothing, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* You added up the numbers that you--

*MR. BLASIER:* Yes.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay. Yes. I'll take your word for it.

*MR. BLASIER:* I'm sorry. 16 of those stains--let's make that 15 since
you said the one was just a trace--indicated mixtures containing
possibly both victims?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, is it also accurate to say that of all of those 23
stains, O.J. Simpson is excluded?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, would you agree that--

*MR. BLASIER:* Could we go back to slide h, please. That's okay.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you agree that this is a fairly--withdraw. The
shirt that was tested, these were stains that were taken from all over
the shirt, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'll have to look at the notes.

*MR. BLASIER:* Let me withdraw that one and I'll ask you another one.
Did you do any of the cuttings on the shirt for these stains?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I did not.

*MR. BLASIER:* And did you examine the shirt at all?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. BLASIER:* Ever? Did you see Gary Sims examining it at all?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I don't recall looking--seeing it.

*MR. BLASIER:* There was a considerable amount of blood on the shirt;
was there not? Do you know that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* From some of the photos I've seen, it appeared to be.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, would you agree that one way that there could be
such carry-over from one victim to the other would be if the clothes
came into contact in some way?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. Calls for speculation, argumentative.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Now, Miss Montgomery, can you tell us in your opinion,
how would you get the kind of mixed stains on both sets of clothing in
so many different stains?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. It's argumentative, may call for speculation
the way it's phrased.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, one of the stains on I believe it was the shirt was
the substrate control; was it not? Actually, it wasn't a stain. It was a
control.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct. There was a substrate control submitted or
substrate control taken with that.

*MR. BLASIER:* And do you know who made the cutting for the substrate
control?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I do not.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, the substrate control, we've had a lot of testimony
about what they are. But just very briefly, that's supposed to be an
area of the shirt where there's no apparent tape, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right. It's best to take a substrate control
that--close to the stain in question, but without any biological fluid
that's detectable such as no blood present.

*MR. BLASIER:* And would you agree that that substrate control showed
the presence of alleles?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I believe it did.

*MR. BLASIER:* And is that an indication that there can be enough blood
or biological material in the sample to cause a result where you can't
see it on the original sample?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence if that's the case.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Umm, could you rephrase that?

*MR. BLASIER:* Yeah. There are two possible ways that could happen. One
is, the controls failed, correct, if you get a reading on a substrate
control that's supposed to be empty?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, the substrate control is to test what the
background of that substrate is.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* So I wouldn't say it failed.

*MR. BLASIER:* Well, "Failed" probably was the wrong term. If it shows
something, it indicates that there's DNA there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And this particular control showed that there was DNA in
an area of the shirt where there didn't appear to be any stain?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, it showed an 18 allele in a region that was
called a control.

*MR. BLASIER:* Was that a yes?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, if it was taken as a control, then the
individual wanted to see what the background of that material was, and
it did show some activity in the background of that material.

*MR. BLASIER:* But by definition, that would have been an area that
didn't have any apparent stain?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. That's argumentative, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* Substrate control, is that supposed to be an area that
doesn't show any apparent stain?

*MR. HARMON:* Same objection, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. As I stated, the substrate control should be an
area that's near the stain, but one that does not give you a presumptive
test for blood or anything such as that.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, I want to ask you some questions about the specific
testing that you performed in this case. Do you have your notes with you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I do. Excuse me.

*MR. BLASIER:* Could you refer to page 5 of your notes?

*THE COURT:* Excuse me. Mrs. Robertson.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm sorry. What page was that?

*MR. BLASIER:* 5.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Now, you on I believe it was August 6th of 1994, you
started testing, and you started to test the reference samples to see
what the types were, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Thank you. I believe the analysis began on August 4th
of 1994.

*MR. BLASIER:* And you amplified--you tried to amplify Mr. Simpson's
reference sample the first time and you got no results, did you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that was a sample that you assumed came from Mr.
Simpson because it was in the reference file labeled Mr. Simpson, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, actually that was a tube. Gary Sims examined the
bloodstains that were submitted pertaining to O.J. Simpson, Ronald
Goldman and Nicole Brown, and he took a portion of the bloodstain and
put it into a centrifuge tube and then he gave me those tubes for the
extraction process. And so the tube was labeled--I have it
specifically--he labeled it with our case number, he labeled it with the
evidence number and then he labeled it O.J. Simpson.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, that was a sample that you expected to have bands
show up, but nothing showed up, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. That's a sample, reference bloodstain from the
individual.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, you had to do that one over again, didn't you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that was because you got no bands the first time?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. There was inhibition in that sample. So there was
no visible band on the D1S80 gel for O.J. Simpson's reference bloodstain.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now "Inhibition" is a term that I think we've heard it a
couple of times. But that means that something happens with the DNA that
the alleles don't amplify. Is that an accurate description?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. It's during the amplification process. Somehow,
there's inhibition of the polymerase to--for the amplification of that
specific allele.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that can occur in samples other than reference
samples too, can't it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Oh, yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* So in mixed samples, you can have inhibition, and some of
the alleles that might be there don't show up?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's unlikely. If you--when you have inhibition, the
whole sample is inhibited. You don't just have inhibition of select
alleles within an amplification.

*MR. BLASIER:* I thought you just said a question or so ago that you
could have alleles that don't show up because of inhibition?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. That's argumentative.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* So you're saying that if there's going to be any
inhibition at all, all of the alleles are going to be inhibited?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. You would have inhibition of the sample, not
inhibition of one particular allele, but inhibition of the alleles in
general.

*MR. BLASIER:* Can you have partial inhibition in--question mark?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I've--I have not seen partial inhibition, no.

*MR. BLASIER:* You can have differences in the efficiency of the
amplification; can you not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, the system has been optimized so you don't get
any of this--what was the word you stated?

*MR. BLASIER:* Inhibition?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, the system has been optimized so you don't have
some of the partial amplification of alleles.

*MR. BLASIER:* When you say it's been optimized, what do you mean?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It's been optimized both at the manufacturer and also
through validation studies, an in-house evaluation of the system. And
this, as I was talking about, the Twgdam requirement, this was one of
the requirements that had to be addressed before D1S80 or any PCR marker
can be used in the laboratory.

*MR. BLASIER:* You're not aware of the phenomenon where a minor
component of a mixture might get lost in the amplification process and
not show up in typing because of the relative quantities of the two
contributors?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Oh, now you're talking a different thing. Now, what
you're referring to is stoichiometric effect where if you have a minor
component, that it's possible--depending on how much of that minor
component is present, it's possible not to see the other contribution.
But that would be at very low levels of DNA.

*THE COURT:* All right. Would you spell stoichiometric for the reporter?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* S-T-O--I believe I need to write it down.

*MR. BLASIER:* S-T-O-C-H-I-O-M-E-T-R-I-C.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* I think.

*THE COURT:* We'll accept that.

*MR. BLASIER:* The test in this case, some of the minor components of
the mixtures involved very small amounts of DNA, didn't they?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Small relative to the initial start--initial DNA, but
not small as I was referring to just in your previous question.

*MR. BLASIER:* So the amounts that you used in this case, you would
never expect to see an allele drop out in amplification?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, there was some samples where we amplified a
small amount by DQ-Alpha and I believe it was--I'd have to look at my
notes, but I believe it was 400 picograms that was amplified. But with
D1S80, we--the smallest amount that was amplified I believe was 800, and
typically we were amplifying well over one nanogram of DNA.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, you also had a problem with one of your standards in
the D1S80 tests that you performed in this case; did you not? I'm
referring to page 28 and 29 of your notes.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. That's not--that does not have anything to do
with the D1S80 system though, and what that is is a slot blot.

*MR. BLASIER:* Well, the slot blot--you used the slot blot to determine
the quantity that you were then going to use for the D1S80 gels, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And one of the standards didn't work right, did it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right. On this one, one of the higher standards, it
was a 40 nanogram, that was outside of the range that we were even
comparing our samples to. These are the standards that are used for
comparison with our unknown DNA's. And one of the 40 nanograms was--was
out of balance compared to some of the other standards that were on the gel.

*MR. BLASIER:* And you had to discard that particular standard because
of that; did you not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. I threw that standard away.

*MR. BLASIER:* Did you do the slot blot over again?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I don't believe I did because the 40-nanogram
standard was irrelevant on the results of the other samples that were on
the gel because everything was at a lower level and it wasn't--the
40-nanogram standard wasn't used as a comparison for the unknown samples.

*MR. BLASIER:* So when something goes wrong with the test, you make some
kind of an assessment that whether it really would affect your results
or not in deciding whether you do something over again?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. One needs to--if something such as that where the
40-nanogram standard was less intense than the 20-nanogram standard, if
something like that happens, one should troubleshoot it and determine
what is happening. And if it appears that it had any bearing on--or any
bearing on your results, then your analysis needs to be repeated. In
this particular case, it was shown that the 40-nanogram standard was
irrelevant because what I was looking at was low levels of DNA in the
unknown samples. And so I was comparing at the lower levels, the
lower-level standards as opposed to the 40-nanogram standards. So--and
basically that 40-nanogram standard did not even need to be placed on
that gel.

*MR. BLASIER:* So your answer is yes. Can we put that down as a yes?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* You'd--actually you'd have to reask the question, please.

*MR. BLASIER:* You also had a problem--I'll pass on that. You also had a
problem with the Rockingham glove, didn't you?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. Vague as to "Problem."

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* Refer you to page 46 of your notes. The first time you
did it, you had a problem, didn't you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Oh, yes. That gel was reanalyzed.

*MR. BLASIER:* And what happened was, the ladder was smeared and
distorted and you had some crossover from one lane to another on the
gel, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. And this demonstrates that when something is
unacceptable in our laboratory, we do reanalysis of the samples. If
there's ever any question, then we reanalyze samples.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, let me refer you to page 62 of your notes. One of
the standards that's used on these gels--and let me ask if we could have
some photographs marked. Actually let me use one of the Prosecution's,
exhibits 275-H.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Can we show that on the elmo, please?

*MR. BLASIER:* I just want to use this for illustrative purposes.
The--if we count three lanes over from the left--

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'll need to come down there to get a look at it.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Three lanes over from the left is called the
one-nanogram control lane; is it not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it is.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that is a known sample that has genotype 1831, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. That's a--that's an additional standard that's
placed on the gel. It's provided within the Roche kit. And as you can
see, the first lane--if I had the little telestrator, I could--

*MR. BLASIER:* Well, I'll show you another picture. We can highlight the
other picture.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay.

*MR. BLASIER:* That is supposed to be--that's supposed to come up 1831
each time you do it, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, that's an additional control. The one--the
control that must--

*THE COURT:* Excuse me. Miss Montgomery, the question was, is that what
comes up.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Could you--I'm sorry. What--

*MR. BLASIER:* That one-nanogram control, that's one of the controls
that you use and that's supposed to light up at 1831 if your test is
being done properly?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes and no. That is a--an additional control, but the
control in question that must respond properly is the first one in
that--after the ladder, and that's the four-nanogram control of an 1831.

*MR. BLASIER:* And the bands on the one-nanogram control, should they be
of equal intensity?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. They're--yes, they should. But the one--the one
in question is actually the four-nanogram.

*MR. BLASIER:* No. The one I'm asking about is the one-nanogram.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right.

*MR. BLASIER:* Should those be of equal intensity?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* One would want them to be of equal intensity, yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* Well--you can resume your seat, please.

/(The witness complies.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* I believe you indicated on direct that your system has
been optimized so bands with equal amounts of DNA will show up with
equal intensity. Did I hear that right?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Miss Montgomery, I showed you a series of pictures or I
gave them to you at lunch for you to look at to see if they were
accurate pictures of some of the films that we've already seen, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And did you agree that the packet I gave you was an
accurate--these were accurate pictures of your films?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, they were.

*MR. BLASIER:* Your Honor, I need to have these marked.

*MR. BLASIER:* Let me ask you just to look at these again just to
satisfy yourself that they're the same.

*THE COURT:* All right. Mr. Blasier, I think these would be 1174. How
many do you have?

*MR. BLASIER:* There are one, two, three, four--seven pictures.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Do we have photo no. 96? And this is--your Honor, what
was the first number?

*THE COURT:* 1174.

/(Deft's 1174 for id = photograph)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Now, Miss Montgomery, this is the--this is just a
picture of the film that you showed us that contains the Bronco samples,
no. 30, 31 and 293, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* And I'm going to highlight or I'm going to--actually I'm
going to magnify the one-nanogram control lane.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Mr. Blasier, are we going to go through all of these
at this time? Would it be easier if I just stayed down at the--

*MR. BLASIER:* Well, I think you should be able to see these on the
monitor. Now, you agree that the lane there on the right is the
one-nanogram control lane?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, you can refer to page 70 of your notes. Would you
agree that when you read this, you read the 18 band of that one-nanogram
control as being brighter than the 31 band? It's a little difficult to
see in the picture. That's why I referred you to your notes.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm--you said page 70 of my notes?

*MR. BLASIER:* Yes.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Could you show me the full scale of this?

*MR. BLASIER:* The picture?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yeah.

*MR. BLASIER:* Sure.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It's difficult looking at it out of context.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. That's not page 70 of my notes.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. Do you have the page of your notes that shows your
work sheet for items 30, 31 and 293? Let me show you my copy.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Actually, yes. It's page 44.

*MR. BLASIER:* Page 44?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you agree that your notes indicate that the 18 is
more intense than the 31?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. I disagree with that.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* My notes don't indicate that at all.

*MR. BLASIER:* All right. Take a look at page 70 of your notes. Are you
looking at your notes?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I am.

*MR. BLASIER:* That was--that's your run sheet from which samples?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Page 70, this is AG, analytical gel, 267, and this is
a composite of many samples, quality control samples, positive controls
from different amplification days and also two controls relating--two
control samples relating to the Bronco, and those are DNA 17--DNA's our
DOJ number--17, which is what, LAPD 30, and then also DNA 18 control,
which is LAPD 31.

*MR. BLASIER:* So that's--is that a different run of the same samples
that we showed in the last picture?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, the first picture you showed was actual samples
that were taken. The samples that related to the controls of the Bronco,
they were samples DNA 17 and DNA 18. Those were two Bronco samples. And
then on the next gel, the one you're referring to now, AG 267, those are
the controls that go with the Bronco samples on that previous gel.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. And those controls were done at a different time
than the samples to which they belonged?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. There's only a limited space on a gel. You
can't--sometimes you can't fit all the samples.

*MR. BLASIER:* Well, on many of these runs, you did put the control
samples with the samples to which they belonged; did you not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. When--when there's enough space, I'll put as many
samples as I can on the gel. But if there's not enough space, then
you're limited with the number you can put on the gel and you'll have to
put it on a different--a separate gel.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, would you agree on your run for the controls, page
70 of your notes, that you determined that the 18 band in your standard,
one-nanogram standard band was greater than the 31 band?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Umm--no. The positive control that goes with those
control samples functioned properly.

*MR. BLASIER:* My question was, did you note in your run sheet that 18
was brighter than 31?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection, vague as to which control.

*MR. BLASIER:* One-nanogram control lane.

*THE COURT:* That's fine.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Oh, okay. The one-nanogram control. Now, this pertains
to a different amplification. This doesn't pertain to the controls that
were put with the Bronco. And yeah, there was an 18, a weak 18, and the
31, there was a hint at the 31. There was a difference in the intensity
of those alleles.

*MR. BLASIER:* And your four-nanogram control lane also had a difference
in intensity; did they not--did it not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it did. There was a gel problem on that region of
the gel. That was the--the farther region of the gel, the last four lanes.

*MR. BLASIER:* That's not the way those controls are supposed to work,
is it? They're supposed to be of equal intensity, aren't they?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. We've optimized the amplification so you get
equal intensity of those alleles. This was a gel effect.

*MR. BLASIER:* Somehow this one didn't get optimized.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. This was a gel effect. This isn't an amplification
effect.

*MR. BLASIER:* So there are some effects on the gel that can cause there
to be different intensities of bands in the same lane?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. I mean that was demonstrated on that particular
sample, on those samples towards the further region of the gel, that
there was a discrepancy between those alleles. And it's a gel art--or
it's a gel polymerization problem.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, you also indicated on your work sheet for
that--those controls that your 31A allele was smeared and not well
defined. Is that also--is that another manifestation of the gel problem?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm sorry. What--which sample?

*MR. BLASIER:* The same one we were looking at, page 70.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. And that gave you an indication that that--that
region of the gel wasn't functioning properly.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, let me refer you to page 62 of your notes. And that
was the run for the positive controls for what? Actually those are sock
samples; are they not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, they are.

*MR. BLASIER:* And you have both some controls and some of the evidence
samples on that run, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And you had a problem on that run as well, did you not,
with your 31 band?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Now--well, that wasn't a problem because on this run,
four nanograms--no, that wasn't a problem.

*MR. BLASIER:* It didn't come out the way it was supposed to come out,
did it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* The one-nanogram control had--the 31 band was darker
than the 18 band, and that's for the one-nanogram control. The
four-nanogram control gave equal intensity of the two alleles.

*MR. BLASIER:* The one-nanogram control was supposed to also give you
bands of equal intensity, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, the one-nanogram control, you would like to have
equal intensity of those two alleles, yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* And--

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* But there--

*MR. BLASIER:* Go ahead.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm sorry. There are situations where you don't get
equal intensity of those two alleles. And that's why at lower levels of
DNA amplification, you need to be cautious with your interpretation.
That's why you strive to amplify more than a nanogram of DNA.

*MR. BLASIER:* Doesn't that mean that with small concentrations of DNA,
you can't really make very precise assessments about band intensity
vis--vis who the contributor was?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, you're saying with--when you have a low level of
DNA, that it's difficult to tell which bands go to which bands? Is that
what you're saying?

*MR. BLASIER:* You have to be much more cautious in terms of trying to
determine who contributed what bands when you're talking about low
levels of DNA?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* If you're talking about very low levels of DNA, yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, we've talked about the--your being unable to amplify
Mr. Simpson's standard--or reference sample the first time, problems
with the standard--the glove that you had to redo, the gel problems that
you've had and the 31 control band that we've talked about. Is this
number of problems typical for the D1S80 system?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. That's argumentative, compound.

*THE COURT:* Sustained. Rephrase the question.

*MR. BLASIER:* Did you ordinarily have these types of problems with
D1S80 or in this case, did you have more problems than usual?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. "Problems" is argumentative.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* These kinds of things going wrong, is this typical of
this system?

*MR. HARMON:* Same objection, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* With the amplification, that's a PCR phenomenon, the
fact that the reference sample did not amplify. And as far as the
other--the other things, the one-nanogram control is used or the
one-nanogram standard is used as an additional control. The main control
that we're concerned with is the four-nanogram, and we want to see equal
intensity of those four-nanogram controls. The system, I have all the
confidence in the system and with the results of the system. So if that
answers your question.

*MR. BLASIER:* I move to strike all of that as nonresponsive.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MR. BLASIER:* Was that a yes or a no? Are these the kinds of things
that happen routinely with the D1S80 system?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. It's argumentative, it's been asked and answered.

*THE COURT:* Rephrase the question.

*MR. BLASIER:* The things we've just been talking about, are these
typical of the D1S80 system?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* They're not typical, no.

*MR. BLASIER:* So more things like we've described happened with respect
to this case than you would expect to see in other D1S80 cases?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. It's argumentative.

*THE COURT:* Sustained. Rephrase the question.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. You said it's not typical. Would you expect in
D1S80 system on a particular case there to be more problems like this or
less?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. It's compound.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Over 20 gels were run in this particular case, which
is more than most cases. And as far as the problems, there were no
significant problems. There was reanalysis on a few of the gels, but
nothing was significant to cause problems with this result. I--there
were not more problems seen in this particular case than seen, you know,
with D1S80 analysis and they weren't major problems.

*MR. BLASIER:* So when you said that this was not typical, you were
indicating that in other cases, you're likely to see more types of
things like this?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. It's argumentative, asked and answered.

*THE COURT:* Sustained. Rephrase the question.

*MR. BLASIER:* Well, you said this wasn't typical, and I asked you, are
there more things, problem areas let's call them, here than in a typical
case. And I don't think you answered that. Could you answer that?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. It's compound, it's argumentative, calls for
speculation.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* By typical doesn't mean--it's not routine that you see
some of these phenomenons occurring. That's what I meant by it's not
typical.

*MR. BLASIER:* So in ordinary cases, you don't see these kinds of things
happen. Is that what you said?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* In ordinary cases. Umm, I'm not quite sure what you mean.

*MR. BLASIER:* May we have photo 100, please? And this will be 1175?

*THE COURT:* 1175.

/(Deft's 1175 for id = photograph)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Now, Miss Montgomery, could you take a look at this and
tell me which run this is? This is--I'll tell you. It's AG184, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And this was the run where you did samples from the Bundy
drops, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it was.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, on this sample, you did both samples of those drops
as well as some of the controls; did you not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And the writing at the top is--that just identifies
what's in the lane below it, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. That's--actually that's Dr. Blake's writing and
his photographs.

*MR. BLASIER:* But do you concur that he has properly labeled the lanes?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, he has.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, the last two lanes over here--I've got the little
arrow on it--the first one is DOJ 24. And what is that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* DOJ 24 as written here is what we call DNA 24. Dr.
Blake tended to call our samples DOJ and in-house we called them DNA,
and that relates to LAPD no. 50 control.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, that's a substrate control for a Bundy drop, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I believe it is, yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that shouldn't have any lanes in it should it, any
bands in it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* What is that, Miss Montgomery?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It's not a band. That's--yeah. If you look at
the--yes. If you look at the original gel, you can see that there's some
blip or glitch. I'm not sure if it's actually cut out of the gel or not.
That's right in between the two lanes, but it's not a band. It's
definitely not a band.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you agree that if that were a band, that means that
your control, the substrate control showed the presence of DNA that
shouldn't be there?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. Calls for speculation.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, how do you tell the difference between something
like that that looks like a band and something that is a very faint band?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, first of all--first of all, this is right in
between two lanes, and samples are loaded into the lane and you would
see distinct banding pattern within that well where they were loaded. As
I'm holding up a gel to demonstrate for you, this is where the wells,
where samples are loaded. Can you see this? And there's a separation
between each--each--where your sample's loaded. That blip right in there
/(Indicating)/ is diffuse smearing blip in the gel, and it could either
be--like I said, it could be just where the gel's been darkened right in
that area, and when it was photoed, it was captured by that. But it's
definitely not a band. It's not a distinct thickened blind.

*MR. BLASIER:* It's not something you expect to see, is it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, you wouldn't expect to see it, but it's not
anything that concerns me.

*MR. BLASIER:* It indicates that something is going on there that
shouldn't be going on there; isn't that accurate?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. I think that's inaccurate to say that.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, we described this as having a band-like appearance.
Would you concur with that? Looks like it could have been a band?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yeah. It has a--you know, there's some darkening in
that region of the gel.

*MR. BLASIER:* And it's at an allele--I'm sorry--it's at a level on the
ladder different from any of the people that you've tested in connection
with this case?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And it's--I believe it's at a 15 allele, isn't it, if
that is a band. That band-like appearance, is a band, it's a 15?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. It's irrelevant, what it could be.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, if you--if you're saying it's a band, then that
would be in between that 14 repeat and the 16 repeat. So that would be
the 15 repeat.

*MR. BLASIER:* This might be a time.

*THE COURT:* Ladies and gentlemen, we'll take our break. Please remember
all of my admonitions. We'll be in recess for 15 minutes.

/(Recess.)/

/(The following proceedings were held in open court, out of the presence
of the jury:)/

//*THE COURT:* Back on the record. Counsel, are you ready to proceed?

*MR. BLASIER:* Yes.

*THE COURT:* All parties are present. Deputy Magnera, let's have the
jurors, please.

/(Brief pause.)/

/(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury:)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Miss Montgomery, why don't you step forward.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Please be
seated. Let the record reflect we have now been rejoined by all the
members of our jury panel. And Miss Renee Montgomery is on the witness
stand undergoing cross-examination by Mr. Blasier. Mr. Blasier, you may
continue with your cross-examination.

*MR. BLASIER:* Thank you, your Honor. Could we have picture 1175 up again?

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Miss Montgomery, I just want to clarify that the
item--the band-like thing down here that we have been talking about
corresponds to the lane at the top for the substrate control, does it not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(No audible response.)/

*MR. BLASIER:* 50C?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* For a Bundy drop?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct. I'm sorry. Actually you should also include
that extraction blank in the second--or in the lane next to the ladder
because since it is right in between those two lanes you need to address
both those lanes.

*MR. BLASIER:* So it could be either one, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, I mean that little artifact is right in between
the two.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, the extraction blank shouldn't show anything either,
should it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. Take it down.

*MR. BLASIER:* I want to ask you a couple of questions about the D1S80
system in general that you talked about on direct. You indicated that it
was a discreet allele system, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And you indicated that it was--everybody matches some of
the bands on the ladder?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I don't believe I stated it that way. Umm--

*MR. BLASIER:* What did you state with respect to the ladder
encompassing all the possible alleles?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay. The ladder is a composite ladder and that means
that from the 14 allele and then the 15 through the 41 allele are
present on that. There are alleles that are greater than the 41 and
there are also--there is possibility that a 15--a 15 allele has been
seen, but it is very rare, and so it is not added into the ladder.

*MR. BLASIER:* So there are alleles in this system that don't show up on
this ladder, correct, because the ladder is too small?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* There are some very rare alleles, like I said, greater
than 41 and then also the 15 allele that are not on this ladder.

*MR. BLASIER:* And those are alleles that could be present in someone's
DNA that would not show up in this system, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. That is not correct. They are--they would not have
a corresponding ladder allele to call them. If there were something
greater than the top 41 allele, and you would see a band up there and I
have seen bands greater than 41 and this is very rare and--so anything
that is greater than 41 is called greater than 41 and it can't be lined
up with any allele ladder. And it happens so infrequently that they
have--the company doesn't feel it is necessary to have ladder alleles up
in that region, which I agree with.

*MR. BLASIER:* But the point you indicated is that alleles don't run off
the gel. There are alleles in this system that do run off the ladder in
the sense that you can't--you can't measure them, correct, with the ladder?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct. I just stated that, yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, when you say a discreet allele system is a good
analogy there, comparing a digital watch with an analog watch that goes
around, a discrete allele system is like a digital watch, meaning that
you are either at one second, two seconds, three seconds, you can't be
in between? Is that what you mean by discreet allele?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That--you could use that analogy.

*MR. BLASIER:* And a clock, for instance, is more like an RFLP system
where you can have alleles spread out from the top to the bottom of the
gel. They are not going to be in discreet positions?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Or continuous. Or another analogy would be shoe size.
When you go in to buy shoes, they have eight and a half, nine, nine and
a half, but you might be in between that eight and a half and nine, so
for RFLP that is how RFLP is addressed, whereas with D1S80 each person
would fit perfectly into that.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that would be because that everybody who is a 25 has
the same sequence of DNA at that location as anybody else that is at 25?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, they have the same number of repeats, so an
individual that is a 25 would have 25 repeats or an individual that is a
25 would have 25 continuous repeats of that particular sequence. There
can be subtle variation, but--and an individual that would be an 18
would have 18 continuous repeats of that region.

*MR. BLASIER:* Well, when you say there can be subtle variations, what
you are saying is that there can be people who show up as a 25, for
instance, that have a different sequence than someone else that shows up
as a 25, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Oh, yes, that is possible. What we are looking at is
length differences; we are not looking at sequence differences with this
system.

*MR. BLASIER:* So two people that come up as a 25 would match in your
system, but if they had a different sequence they are different people,
aren't they?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, that's true.

*MR. BLASIER:* So your system does not have the ability, even though you
call it a discreet allele system, to identify precisely the sequence in
a particular band?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right. We are looking at length differences.

*MR. BLASIER:* And unlike PCR and DQ-Alpha, which does identify specific
sequences of DNA, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* So this in a sense is--this aspect of the system is
closer to the RFLP system where you are just--you are estimating
sequences in a sense, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, we are not estimating sequences. We are not not
looking at the sequence. We are looking at length differences between
individuals, how many repeats they have. It is a 16-base pair repeat, so
an individual that is an 18 has 18 of these 16 base pair repeats and
they would have a repeat sequence that is, say, this long, whereas an
individual that is a 25 would have repeats sequences that are even
longer. The same repeat sequence, the same number of repeats, but just a
different length.

*MR. BLASIER:* The point is, different alleles would come up as the
same, 25, 24, whatever and they would be different alleles, wouldn't they?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* If there is a sequence difference between two
individuals, they can run to the same position, but it is the length
difference we are looking at, not the sequence difference.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, there is also reports in the literature, B bands in
the D1S80 system not lining up correctly with the ladder, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That is correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And there have been reports in the literature of bands
going to a place on the ladder that is different from what the true
sequence is, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Going to a place on the ladder different than the true--

*MR. BLASIER:* I'm sorry?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Repeating your question to myself. There is--if there
is a sequence difference, it is possible that there could be just a very
subtle variation, but it will still line up with the ladder, the
composite ladder allele that is adjacent to it, provided in the Roche kit.

*MR. BLASIER:* Well, the report--the literature indicates that there are
situations where it is so far out of line with the ladder that it can be
confused with the band above it?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. It is argumentative and it is vague.

*THE COURT:* Sustained. Rephrase the question.

*MR. BLASIER:* Are you aware of the literature that talks about the
mobility of bands being such that you can mistype which rung of the
ladder you are on because the band size is somewhere in the middle?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. That was early on during the development of this
system, and what happened is some of the laboratories were trying to use
their conventional serology--

*MR. BLASIER:* Your Honor, I'm going to object as being nonresponsive at
this point.

*THE COURT:* Sustained. Restate your question.

*THE COURT:* Mobility of bands.

*MR. BLASIER:* I think she answered. The first part of her answer--I'm
satisfied with the first part.

*THE COURT:* All right.

*MR. HARMON:* Your Honor, could--that was an explanation, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* No.

*MR. HARMON:* Could you read it back? I think you will see it is an
explanation.

*THE COURT:* Counsel, you can cover that on redirect. Proceed.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, this system also has a characteristic that if
samples are degraded you can lose bands, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* You could lose your entire--you could get no results
with degraded samples, yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* You can also selectively lose bands, can't you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* At very, very low levels. It is unusual to lose just--

*MR. BLASIER:* Is that a yes?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection, that is argumentative.

*THE COURT:* Sustained. Rephrase the question.

*MR. BLASIER:* You can lose--well, let me rephrase it. The ladder that
is in the D1S80 system comprises fragment lengths that go from about,
what, 300 base pairs up to a couple thousand maybe?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It ranges from a little under 400 base pairs up to
over 800 base pairs.

*MR. BLASIER:* And when a sample degrades it generally starts to break
down, the larger fragments get cut--get broken up first, there still may
be shorter fragments while the degradation process is going on, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, it is a random act that is occurring, the
degradation of DNA, and that is just cutting at various locations on the
geno.

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* So your understanding that when degradation occurs and
DNA fragments are cut up, they are cut up randomly in the sense
that--well, let me rephrase that. When you start chopping up the
D.A.--the DNA you lose--

*THE COURT:* All right. Let's have it quiet in the courtroom, please.

*MR. BLASIER:* When you start chopping up, the DNA gets cut into
successfully smaller pieces?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* If it fully degrades you may not see any bands at all
correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* As it degrades further the bands that are longer, that
represent longer sequences, you no longer can see, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* So you can lose the upper bands of a genotype? For
instance, if somebody is an 18, 31 and the sample is degrading, you
could lose the 31 and the person would appear to be an 18, 18, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, theoretically that's correct, but from all the
method--all the research that has been done and all the studies that
have been done, what has been demonstrated is when you get to the level
of degradation you typically don't see any result, and if you do see
result, you will see something just so faint that you wouldn't be
confident even calling that a genotype.

*MR. BLASIER:* So are you saying that the kit has been developed to the
extent that you would not see this particular phenomenon of the upper
band disappearing?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, it is not the kit that has been developed to do
that. It is just studies that have been done within laboratories to
demonstrate whether this possibly can occur, and these are environmental
abuse studies that have been done.

*MR. BLASIER:* You are familiar with the perk and Elmer AMP-FLP D1S80
kit manual, are you not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* The product insert?

*MR. BLASIER:* Yes.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I am.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that talks about one of the problems of this system
being--one of the interpretation problems, that you may lose larger
bands with a degraded sample, does it not?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection, that calls for hearsay.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* Let me show you--let me ask you: Are you aware--let me
show you.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Are you familiar with that kit insert?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I am.

*MR. BLASIER:* And is that what you have in your hand?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it is.

*MR. BLASIER:* And do you rely on that in performing the tests that you
perform?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. This was their amplification conditions are used
in our laboratory for our analysis.

*MR. BLASIER:* Please look at page 18 section 8.3.1.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/

*MR. BLASIER:* Have you ever read that section before?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I have.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you agree that that says that you may lose larger
bands if a sample is degraded?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* What it states is that when you have a single-banded
pattern that your results should be interpreted with caution. The--the
company has also done some follow-up research in which they've published
a paper in May of--

*MR. BLASIER:* Your Honor, I object. This is not responsive.

*THE COURT:* All right. Proceed.

*MR. BLASIER:* And wouldn't you agree that the kit insert also tells you
that some alleles don't align up with the ladder, referring to 8.3.2
right below that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, that's true.

*MR. BLASIER:* And does that indicate that there are a couple of reasons
why that might happen as well?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. That calls for hearsay, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MR. BLASIER:* Are you familiar with the section that I'm talking about,
8.3.2?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that gives several reasons why you might have bands
that don't line up the way they are supposed to with the ladder, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, and these are subtle shifts that they are
referring to in this section.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, the kit also is warranted for amplification of 2.5
nanograms of DNA or more, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. They state in here that they guarantee results
with 2.5 nanograms of DNA.

*MR. BLASIER:* And many of the tests that you ran in this case were on
amounts far less than that, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(No audible response.)/

*MR. BLASIER:* Or I should say components of mixtures?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. We amplified some samples down to one nanogram.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, the D1S80 system is less informative than the RFLP
system because it has fewer alleles? Would you agree with that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, we are looking at one region on the D1S80 system
whereas with RFLP we are looking at various regions, as Dr. Cotton and
Mr. Sims discussed.

*MR. BLASIER:* Let me break it down then. You are only looking at one
location on the geno?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* One place in the DNA? With RFLP, with a single probe, you
are also looking at one location in the DNA, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And with RFLP, however, you can have many different
alleles, 60, 70, 80 different alleles for a given probe, can you not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Sure. Yes, you can.

*MR. BLASIER:* And in the D1S80 system you have a fewer number of
possible alleles, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* So there is less variation among people in the D1S80
system than in the RFLP system because there is fewer possible alleles
that you could find in people, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. By comparing D1S80 to RFLP profiles.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, the 24 allele is extremely common, is it not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, the 24 allele is one of the more common alleles.

*MR. BLASIER:* In fact, over a third of the Caucasian population will
have that, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(No audible response.)/

*MR. BLASIER:* Approximately?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. I believe approximately thirty percent will have,
within their genotype, a 24 or an 18 allele.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that makes this system in this particular case where
both Mr. Simpson and Mr. Goldman have 24 alleles, makes it less
informative than if they had more rare alleles, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, with Mr. Goldman, he is a 24 homozygote. With
Mr. Simpson you need to look at the other allele that goes along with
that 24 allele.

*MR. BLASIER:* My question is when you have a 24 allele it is less--it
is a less informative system than if you have a more rare allele,
correct, because you can't narrow it down as far in terms of the
potential contributors?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct. If you had two rare alleles, then it would be
more informative, right.

*MR. BLASIER:* It would be better. And the 18 allele, Nicole Brown
Simpson is an 18, 18 and that is always very common allele, is it not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct. By "Very common," as I just stated a few
sentences back, that between the 18 and the 24 alleles, you will see
this in one--that allele in approximately sixty percent of the
population, either the 18 or the 24, but then you also look at the other
allele that goes with the individual.

*MR. BLASIER:* In fact, well if we do that with 18, 18, that is actually
a fairly common genotype, is it not, 6 percent of the population has it,
Caucasian population?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I would have to refer to my notes for the exact frequency.

*MR. BLASIER:* Why don't you do that.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, an 18, 18 occurs in approximately 6 percent of
the Caucasian population.

*MR. BLASIER:* So of a hundred people you would expect there to be six
people that would have that combination, Caucasians?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Approximately six out of a hundred.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that--because that allele is involved, that is much
less informative than if you had a rare genotype?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. If you had a rarer one, then you would have less
occurrence in the population.

*MR. BLASIER:* And the fact that Mr. Goldman shares an allele with Mr.
Simpson makes it even less informative because there may be some
difficulty in assessing who is responsible for the 24 allele? Would you
agree with that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* You are talking about mixtures now?

*MR. BLASIER:* Yes.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* And would it be--I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

*MR. BLASIER:* Because there is an allele in common, that makes it--that
makes it more difficult for you to separate components of a mixture
because there is one allele that two people have in common? Would you
agree with that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Let me ask you to refer to page 91 of your notes.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/

*MR. BLASIER:* Do you have that in front of you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm afraid I'm going to lose all of them.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, do you and Mr. Sims and the other people in your lab
use the same standards to decide whether something is a hint versus a
trace versus a C minus versus a C?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* As it pertains to D1S80?

*MR. BLASIER:* Yes.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. There is no standard technology as to hint,
trace, for D1S80. So what happens is when someone is second reading the
gel, they call it, and if they call it something different than the
first analyst, then you document it in your notes. If they aren't
calling it a hint, then you write what they are actually calling it.

*MR. BLASIER:* But the term hint and trace mean different things?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(No audible response.)/

*MR. BLASIER:* Correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. A hint would be less than a trace.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. And everybody in your lab conforms to that standard?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Typically, yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* Is that a standard that is set out anywhere in any of the
manuals?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, it is not.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you agree that that has a certain subjective
element to it? One examiner might call something a hint and another
person might call the same thing a trace?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection, calls for speculation, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It is possible. When you get down to those lower
levels, umm, a hint would be--a hint uniformly throughout the laboratory
by a DNA analyst--case work analyst is something that--there is a hint
there. That is an indication that something is there, but you can't be
confident that it is actually a band. A trace then uniformly through the
lab is there is a band there. It is very, very weak band.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, you--on page 91 of your notes, that is a run where
you were looking at what types of samples?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(No audible response.)/

*MR. BLASIER:* That is your dna-59.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Those are four stains from Mr. Goldman's jeans.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, would you agree that on--in your lane no. 12 on your
work notes you described that as a 24, 24 with a hint of an 18?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And the second reader scored it the same way, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, and also the supervisor who reviewed it scored it
the same also.

*MR. BLASIER:* What did you report that as in your report?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(No audible response.)/

*MR. BLASIER:* I ask you to refer to your report at page--I'm sorry,
April 6, 1995, page 8 of 11.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That was reported out as a 24 homozygote with a
possible trace 18 allele.

*MR. BLASIER:* What is the difference between a possible trace and a
trace and a hint?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, a--there is a difference between actually
writing your observations on your work sheet and doing your
interpretation. Your work sheet is what you actually observed and then
you--one needs to think about how they are going to word these reports,
and with--I could have written in the report a hypothetical of an 18
allele. But a possible trace, the words sound more effective than a hint
of an 18 allele, so the three of us that wrote this report, Mr. Sims,
Mr. Myers and myself, discussed it and tried to come up with the correct
wording that would adequately describe what we saw. And what we came up
with was possible trace, and that is not saying that there is a trace of
an 18. That is saying there is possibly a band there but we are not
confident in calling it.

*MR. BLASIER:* When you say you want to do it more effectively, in other
words, to put forward the Prosecution's case?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, not at all. To reflect what the evidence--to
reflect what the evidence is. It doesn't matter if it helps the
Prosecution or the Defense; we are just reporting the science.

*MR. BLASIER:* What changed between your reading of the actual film and
when you wrote the report to cause you to change the way that was described?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection, argumentative, assumes facts not in evidence.

*THE COURT:* Sustained. Rephrase the question.

*MR. BLASIER:* Did something change in terms of your analysis of this
particular test result? Did you read it again? Did something change?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. To write a hint in a report, it just doesn't--what
does a hint mean in a report? Umm, in the laboratory I know what a hint
means and I am able to hopefully tell you what a hint means. But in a
report, for someone just to pick this report up and be able to read it,
whether it is the Prosecution or the Defense, we need to convey what we
are trying to get across to them and by saying a possible trace, that
conveys that we are not confident that a band exists there, and to just
say a hint of an 18, to me it doesn't state it a effectively as saying a
possible trace.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, unlike RFLP technology, you don't use any kind of
computer aids to determine whether there is a band there and whether it
is a hint or a trace or possible trace, do you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. That is one of the great things about this system.
We get to use the basics.

*MR. BLASIER:* You just look at it and you say looks like a trace to me
or looks like a hint to this guy, right?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. It is all based on one's experience also.

*MR. BLASIER:* And every analyst that looks at these things always comes
up with the same terminology, hint, trace, possible trace?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well--

*MR. HARMON:* Objection, calls for speculation, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, I can't--outside of our laboratory, I'm not
quite sure if people would put the same words to these. It is--in our
laboratory it is pretty well-defined, and as you could see on this
particular one, three different individuals read it and they all came up
with the same word, hint, at 18.

*MR. BLASIER:* Have you ever done any studies where you have looked at
different quantities of DNA in a mixture, for instance, to see if--to
see what happens when you start reducing the quantity to determine at
what point a band becomes an artifact?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I have done studies to demonstrate at which level
or at what level you start losing a minor component.

*MR. BLASIER:* And have you published any opinion studies that show the
differences in intensity of the bands between a hint and a trace and a C
minus?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I have not.

*MR. BLASIER:* And there is no scale that you use to do this, is there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. It is a scale that is made in our laboratory

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* I'm sorry?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It is made in our laboratory and it is just a scale, a
progression, as I described earlier.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, as a sample degrades--have you done any testing to
determine what happens when a sample is degraded in terms of how it
shows up, whether it shows up as a band or an artifact?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. I did some temperature studies in the laboratory
to see what happened when various samples were subjected to various
temperatures for differing amounts of time.

*MR. BLASIER:* It is not like a light switch, is it, where you--it is
either there or it isn't there? There are gradiations of band
intensities, are there not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That is true, yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* You must use your subjective judgment to decide whether
something is really a band as opposed to an artifact, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, when one gets to the lower level where you are
not sure if it is a band, then yes, that's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, when you read these things, did you know what
genotypes the two victims and Mr. Simpson had?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection, "These things" as vague, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* All the evidence samples that you read, when you did
that, did you know the genotypes of Mr. Simpson and the two victims?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I did.

*MR. BLASIER:* So you knew what results you expected to get, at least as
to some of the contributors, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I didn't know what I expected to get, no.

*MR. BLASIER:* You knew what alleles were common to this case, did you not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I did.

*MR. BLASIER:* You knew these were evidence samples from this case, did
you not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I did.

*MR. BLASIER:* You didn't have any kind of expectation in your mind that
perhaps these evidence samples would produce these bands?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, no, because that is part of testing the
evidence, is to show who can be excluded and who can't be excluded.

*MR. BLASIER:* Do you know--are you familiar with a term examiner bias?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I have heard that.

*MR. BLASIER:* What does that mean?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* You know, I believe I have only heard it in the
context of--let me back up. I--examiner bias I think would be an
individual having some bias on their examination.

*MR. BLASIER:* Have you ever heard it used in the context of one who
knows the results they are supposed to get and subconsciously getting
the results that they think they are supposed to do, not through any
trickery or lying or anything, but you see what you think you are going
to see?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* So someone could produce bands on the gel? Is that
what you are stating?

*MR. BLASIER:* Someone might interpret one thing as an artifact or as a
faint band, depending on what they expect to see?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm not aware of that happening, no.

*MR. BLASIER:* You are not aware of any studies that talk about that
particular phenomena?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I haven't read any studies that address that, no.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, the--you indicated that the range of size of the
fragments in the D1S80 system was about 400 to 800 base pairs?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Roughly, yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* And the size of the fragments in the DQ-Alpha system are
less than 400 base pairs, correct; it is about 240?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct, 242.

*MR. BLASIER:* So would you agree that in a degrading sample you would
expect the D1S80 bands to disappear the DQ-Alpha allele from a
particular piece of DNA?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. That is possible.

*MR. BLASIER:* So that if you had a mixed sample, let's say in the
DQ-Alpha, you see evidence of a mixture, but you don't see any extra
alleles in the D1S80 system, that might be explained by the fact that
the sample is degraded?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. And one needs to also look at their yield gel to
determine if degradation was occurring on that, if it is possible.

*MR. BLASIER:* You are aware that the Bundy drops in this case were
severely degraded or are you aware of that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I believe some of the samples were degraded.

*MR. BLASIER:* And are you aware of the DQ-Alpha testing results on the
steering wheel sample, that is item 29?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I am.

*MR. BLASIER:* And you are aware that there was a 4 allele which is
inconsistent with a genotype of any of the three people in this case?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, there was a weaker 4 allele detected on the
steering wheel sample.

*MR. BLASIER:* And the reason it was inconsistent is because there was
no 1.3 to go along with that which would have been consistent with
Ronald Goldman?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Right. There was a very low level amplification--or a
low level amplification.

*MR. BLASIER:* Never tested the steering wheel, item no. 29, with a
D1S80 system, did you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, we didn't.

*MR. BLASIER:* There was no efforts made to try and find out what
alleles might be present?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. There wasn't enough DNA present to analyze it by
the D1S80 system.

*MR. BLASIER:* And how do you know that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Because I remember discussing that issue with Gary
Sims at the time that we were doing the analysis on those samples.

*MR. BLASIER:* How much DNA was present?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I will have to refer to Gary Sims' notes to tell you that.

*MR. BLASIER:* All right.

/(Brief pause.)/

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*THE COURT:* Miss Montgomery, have you located that item in your notes?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I have.

*THE COURT:* All right. Will you give counsel the page reference.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It is on Gary Sims page 40. There is another advantage
to numbering pages, I guess.

*MR. BLASIER:* What page are you referring to?

*THE COURT:* Gary Sims 40.

*MR. BLASIER:* 36?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* 40.

*THE COURT:* Gary Sims 40.

*MR. BLASIER:* 40?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Sorry.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Mr. Blasier, do you want to compare your notes
with Miss Montgomery's?

*MR. BLASIER:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* The quantity was approximately .9, was it not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it was.

*THE COURT:* .9 what? Nanograms?

*MR. BLASIER:* Nanograms?

*THE COURT:* Miss Montgomery, nanograms?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct. .9 nanograms.

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, to be--two significant digits Gary wrote 2.86
nanograms.

*MR. BLASIER:* And you have performed D1S80 tests on amounts less than
that, haven't you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I have.

*MR. BLASIER:* So it wasn't a matter of there not being enough to test,
was it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. It was a matter of there not being enough to test
due to the fact that this sample was first used for DQ-Alpha, and after
using a portion of it for the DQ-Alpha typing there wasn't enough sample
left for D1S80 typing.

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Could we have note 95, please.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* This will be--what are we up to?

*THE COURT:* This would be 1176. Mrs. Robertson, 1176? Yes. Defense 1176.

/(Deft's 1176 for id = photograph)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Miss Montgomery, could you look at the monitor and tell
me if that appears to be a photograph of your run no. 297?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. Actually this analysis was done by Steve Myers at
our laboratory.

*MR. BLASIER:* And this is--has samples from Nicole Brown Simpson's
dress, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it does.

*MR. BLASIER:* And the interpretation of this sample for samples G5 and
G6 were an 18 allele stronger than a 24 allele?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* You are referring to G3?

*MR. BLASIER:* No, G5 and 6. Let me highlight those at the top. You see
G5 and G6?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* And you agree that that is an accurate picture of that
film for that particular run?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it is, but once--once again, it is difficult to
see the weaker components of this and you will actually have to look at
the gels yourself.

*MR. BLASIER:* All right. Let me zoom in on G5 and 6. Would you agree
that you cannot see any 24 allele at least on this picture?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(No audible response.)/

*MR. BLASIER:* What you see is the 18's, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* There is nothing apparent here?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, this is all done with your computer. I mean,
this isn't the actual sample and so I don't know--

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you look at your original sample and tell me if you
agree that it is extremely faint?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(Witness complies.)/ it is a trace level of 24.

*MR. BLASIER:* So this is a trace--

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* But you--

*MR. BLASIER:* I'm sorry.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* But you can see it in here and when you do see a copy
of it later on you will be able to see that it is a trace amount of a 24
allele.

*MR. BLASIER:* How much more is it than a hint?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, a hint, as I stated, is a--a hint is a possible.
It is not a well-defined band. These trace, these are well-defined
bands, they are just very faint, and as far as why you can't see it on
your monitor, I can't explain that.

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MS. MONTGOMERY:* This is the actual copy.

*MR. BLASIER:* I'm sorry, do you have the actual one there?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I do.

*MR. BLASIER:* Could we take a look at that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, but I would prefer that it not be, umm, put into
evidence. Mr. Harmon has a copy of the blue copies.

*MR. BLASIER:* Well, let me use the blue copy. Is that adequate?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. Mr. Harmon has those copies, I believe.

*THE COURT:* Mrs. Robertson.

*MR. BLASIER:* Did we give that a number?

*THE COURT:* Yes, we did.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* This is run 297.

*THE COURT:* 297.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Can we put--this is exhibit 275-I. Can we put this on
the elmo?

/(Brief pause.)/

//*THE COURT:* Mrs. Robertson.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* I don't think that is the right one.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*THE COURT:* Does it say AG297 on that, Mr. Harris?

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. HARRIS:* Yes, it does, your Honor.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I believe it is just backwards or upside down.

*MR. BLASIER:* Oh, okay.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Now, the area of interest--now, the area of interest
that we are looking at are the two lanes over toward the right between
the two ladders, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And you are saying that there is something more than a
hint, which is a band at 24?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And can we put arrows in that area, Mr. Harris.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* And can we print that out, please.

/(Brief pause.)/

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* And I would like to have that shown to the jury,
please, if we could mark that printout.

*THE COURT:* All right. If you will hand--do you want to hand the blue
copy--

*MR. BLASIER:* Maybe we could hand both at the same time.

*THE COURT:* All right.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*THE COURT:* It takes about three minutes to print that out?

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Could we make the printout 1176, please.

*THE COURT:* 1177?

*MR. BLASIER:* 1177.

*THE COURT:* Or do you want to make the printout 1176-A?

*MR. BLASIER:* Whatever your pleasure is.

*THE COURT:* Well, do you want to keep them together?

*MR. BLASIER:* I think we just have one--that's fine.

*THE COURT:* All right.

*MR. BLASIER:* That is a good idea. 1176-A.

*THE COURT:* All right.

/(Deft's 1176-A for id = photograph)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Actually, your Honor, let's hold off on that and show
another picture and we can do a couple of them at the same time, if that
is okay.

*THE COURT:* Proceed.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Mr.--

*THE COURT:* I'm sorry.

*MR. BLASIER:* Could we have photo 92, please?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Could I see that blue copy?

*MR. BLASIER:* Sure.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Thank you.

*MR. BLASIER:* Your Honor, could this be marked as the next in order?

*THE COURT:* 1177.

*MR. BLASIER:* 1177.

/(Deft's 1177 for id = photograph)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Now, Miss Montgomery, the picture that we have put up
now, 1177, contains the samples from Nicole Brown Simpson's fingernail
scrapings, does it not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it does.

*MR. HARMON:* I have an objection, your Honor. May we approach on this?
It relates to what Miss Montgomery said a moment ago.

*THE COURT:* All right. With the court reporter, please.

/(The following proceedings were held at the bench:)/

//*THE COURT:* Okay. We are over at the side bar. Mr. Harmon, what is--

*MR. HARMON:* Well, correct me if I am wrong. I am not a computer buff
here, but what has happened is Blake has taken photos and those photos
have been scanned into a computer and that is what we are projecting up
there, and Miss Montgomery just pointed out on this, I guess the Blasier
version of what that is, Mr. Fung--the computer is changing data and we
are projecting things up there. I don't mind projecting the photo up
there from the elmo, but we are--this thing--this stuff has been sieved
through all these filters and those bands have nice ninety-degree angles
on them and this is a function of the computer and it is not a function
of the data that is there. So to force this witness and now this jury to
show things that have been enhanced or fuzzed up by a computer, it is
changing the data from which she--she made these readings, so I don't
have any objection to the photos. But you look at that--at that last
one, I don't know if it is 1176, those things look like nice ninety
degree rectangles there and that is not what is on the original data and
to--I mean, I guess I was asleep at the wheel when I didn't realize.

*THE COURT:* Well, then that--all right. That exhibit has come and gone
then. We will take it up later.

*MR. HARMON:* We are on to another one here and I think that is very
deceptive to use something that has been run through a computer to--to I
don't want to use the term that comes to mind, but to confront a witness
with something that is not what she saw and then have her--force her to
pull out a copy. I don't think that is really fair and it is misleading
and it is argumentative and it is time--

*THE COURT:* All right. We will take this up later. We are not dealing
with it now so it has come and gone.

*MS. CLARK:* It is here again.

*MR. HARMON:* It is back again.

*MR. BLASIER:* I gave these to her at lunch and I also told her anytime
she wants to pull out the original, that is fine, no problem, and we
will pass the original and the photo to the jury. That is fine with me.

*MR. HARMON:* That is neither here nor there. You see, he just said
there is a difference. Why have we been sitting here all afternoon?

*THE COURT:* Counsel, isn't it a little late for you to bring this up?

*MR. HARMON:* Judge, better late than never, second time this week, but
you have to decide based on what we already know, not on how I screwed
up last week.

*THE COURT:* Keep your voice down. So let's proceed.

*MR. HARMON:* Sure.

*THE COURT:* Lay a foundation.

/(The following proceedings were held in open court:)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Mr. Blasier, we will just have to hold on for
a second.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Mr. Blasier, you may continue.

*MR. BLASIER:* Thank you. Could we have 1177, please.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, Miss Montgomery, this is one of the pictures that
you looked at at lunch to compare with your original film, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. HARMON:* Objection, it misstates the testimony. It is not one of
the pictures, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* Sustained. Rephrase the question.

*MR. BLASIER:* Well, this is a scanned image of the photograph that I
have right here. Would you like to look at it.

*MR. HARMON:* Objection, it is irrelevant.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you like to look at the photograph that you looked
at to assure yourself it is the same one?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection, that is irrelevant.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* If you would like to hand that to me, sure.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MS. MONTGOMERY:* And yes, this is a photograph that you asked me to
look at during lunchtime and it appears to be a photograph taken by Dr.
Ed Blake of one of my D1S80 gels.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. Does it appear substantially the same as the
scanned photograph, the same photograph?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. It is irrelevant whether it is substantially
the same, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* Sustained. Rephrase the question.

*MR. BLASIER:* I'm sorry. Does it appear to be the same on the screen as
what you have in your hand?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, it has the same labeling and everything. I mean,
this is a computer scan of the actual picture, so it appears similar. It
is missing some of the--the side writing that is on these pictures.

*MR. BLASIER:* Does it look any different at all, other than the side
writing, other than the scanned image being a little smaller?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, it looks very similar. I mean, it appears to be
the same one scanned into a computer.

*MR. BLASIER:* You compared these photographs with your films during
lunch, did you not?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I did.

*MR. BLASIER:* And you indicated to me after lunch that these appeared
to be accurate representations of your films, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct. I mean, as I stated earlier, you need to
actually see one of the blue copies to see some of the subtle or some of
the less intense bands and I assume you will be seeing those later.

*MR. BLASIER:* And if any of these pictures that I show you--if
something else is revealed on your copy, you tell me and we will show
your copy as well, okay?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Okay.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, this is the run that you did with the sample from
the fingernail scrapings, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And the fingernail scrapings appear in these lanes, 45B,
46B and 45A1, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct. Those are the scrapings and the clippings.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. Which is which, just so it is clear?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* 45B--referring to my notes, 45B is the right scraping,
46B is the left scraping, and 45A-B1 is the right clipping.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, let me back out of this and I want to highlight
those three lanes. Now, would you agree that there appears to be
something going on below the 18 allele, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* You know, you are focusing in on these and zooming
them up. You need to look at the actual gel. We don't image our gels. We
just do a hands-on look at the gel.

*MR. HARMON:* Objection, move to strike, and I would ask the Court to
take that exhibit off the screen, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* No. Proceed.

*MR. BLASIER:* Let's look at your original of this one, okay?

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MS. MONTGOMERY:* What was the gel number again? AG293?

*MR. BLASIER:* 293.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, this is my original. I have taped to the back a
transparency with the labeling on it, but it is just a temporary
removable item.

*MR. BLASIER:* And would you agree that the area that I have--that I
have blown up here conforms to what is on your original in terms of
this--these band-like items below 18?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, no. This is like taking a very close-up
photograph and trying to ask the person what they see in the whole
photograph. You need to look at the big picture. You can't just focus in
like that.

*MR. BLASIER:* Well, look at the big picture.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It is inaccurate. By looking at this gel, there is
just some silver precipitation in this region, and once again, you will
be able to see these, and there is just, you know, a little darkening
down here. It is not a band by any means.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you agree that it looks like what we have up on the
screen?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, this is a magnification.

*MR. BLASIER:* Yes.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I mean, if I were to try to magnify this with my eyes,
yes, but I think you need to look at the actual data and not magnify it
up like that.

*MR. BLASIER:* Well, look at it--does it look like there is something
going on below the 18 allele at the position of the 17 allele under 46B?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. What you can see is if you look up at the gel, you
could see a smearing from the first ladder all the way--I can't see it
from here, but if you look at the first ladder and all the way over to
past the second to the last ladder, you will see this dark smearing and
that is just a little silver beam precipitation. That is just a
smearing. It is during the staining process, and it is not by any means
a band.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you agree that neither Nicole Brown Simpson, Ronald
Goldman or O.J. Simpson have a 17 allele in the D1S80 system?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I agree with that, yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, this smearing that you are talking about that causes
that activity in the 17 allele, is this something that went wrong with
this test?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. BLASIER:* Is this kind of smearing, something that you typically
see where you would have--call them band like appearances appear on the
gels.

*MR. HARMON:* Objection, misstates the testimony.

*THE COURT:* Sustained. Rephrase the question.

*MR. BLASIER:* Is this kind of smearing something that is typical for
D1S80--the D1S80 system?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It is not--well, no, I don't typically see something
like this, and it is just like I said, the silver is being precipitated
and causing a nice flowing smear through that portion of the gel.

*MR. BLASIER:* Did you run this again to see whether that activity at
allele 17 disappeared?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, I don't see any activity at allele 17.

*MR. BLASIER:* Did you run this again?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I did not.

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Well, we have the picture itself. Your Honor, I would
ask that this particular photograph, as well as the last one, be
circulated to the jury.

*THE COURT:* All right. At this time? All right.

*MR. BLASIER:* And--

*THE COURT:* 1177 and 1176 with the printout.

*MR. BLASIER:* And the last one we'll submit the blue copy as well.

*THE COURT:* All right. All right. Would you hand 1177--Mr. Blasier,
would you hand 1177 to juror no. 7 and hand 1176 and the blue copy to
juror no. 1.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. Now, the--the photograph that is up here, she has
been referring to her original which is different from the blue copy,
and I'm wondering if the Court would like me to circulate her original
with my photograph just so the jury could look at both?

*THE COURT:* May I see the original?

/(Brief pause.)/

//*THE COURT:* Is this something a lay person can read by looking at it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Oh, yes. These are--you want to try to avoid touching
the gel because you don't want to leave your oils on it.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Then we ought to do this one set at a time.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay.

*THE COURT:* All right. Ladies and gentlemen, be careful how you handle
the original gel, please.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* If you could just handle them on the side. Just like
photographs, if you touch the center, it can cause some residues.

*MR. BLASIER:* I will hand 275-I and our printout, which is 1176-A.

*THE COURT:* All right.

/(The exhibits were passed amongst the jurors.)/

//*THE COURT:* And while the jury is looking at that, let me see
counsel, without the reporter.

/(A conference was held at the bench, not reported.)/

/(The following proceedings were held in open court:)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Mr. Blasier, you wanted to give the jury also
which exhibit?

*MR. BLASIER:* Her original and my photograph.

*THE COURT:* All right.

*THE COURT:* How about if we ask everybody to hold it by the tape.

*MR. BLASIER:* I'm sorry?

/(The exhibits were passed amongst the jurors.)/

//*MR. HARMON:* Your Honor, may I approach the witness?

/(Discussion held off the record between Mr. Harmon and the witness.)/

//*THE COURT:* Mr. Harmon, why don't you step over here a second with
Mr. Cochran.

*MR. COCHRAN:* Yes, your Honor.

/(A conference was held at the bench, not reported.)/

/(The following proceedings were held in open court:)/

//*THE COURT:* Mr. Blasier, would you rescue the first set from Deputy
Russell.

/(Brief pause.)/

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

/(Discussion held off the record between Deputy District Attorney and
Defense counsel.) (Discussion held off the record between the Deputy
District Attorneys.)/

//*MS. CLARK:* Can we approach, please, your Honor?

/(The following proceedings were held at the bench:)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. We are over at the side bar.

*MR. HARMON:* The problem that exists is when you are using systems to
show that something is not there when it really is and you allow
something that takes away data, you are really misleading the jury.

*THE COURT:* Show me what is--what is not where.

*MR. COCHRAN:* What is not where.

*MR. HARMON:* Well, the whole point of this is to question whether or
not there is anything there.

*THE COURT:* Okay.

*MR. HARMON:* Somehow Howard put the arrows because he is looking at this.

*MR. BLASIER:* No, because 24 is a marker lane.

*MR. HARMON:* How does he know?

*MR. BLASIER:* I told him. This is just to help them locate what to look
for on here.

*MR. HARMON:* So you are saying that there is something faint here?

*MR. HARMON:* Sure.

*THE COURT:* Okay. Right there, /(Indicating)/.

*MR. HARMON:* Right.

*THE COURT:* All right. Have you got that turned around right? Why don't
you superimpose it.

*MR. HARMON:* You are right.

*THE COURT:* Turn it around.

*MR. HARMON:* I'm getting dizzy here.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. HARMON:* Ours is the photo from Blake's.

*THE COURT:* This is 297, 297.

*MR. HARMON:* I guess you really can't because they are different sizes,
but it is right in here, /(Indicating)/.

*MR. HARMON:* It is okay to just illustrate something that is there, but
when you are trying to demonstrate that something is not there and you
have the system that--

*THE COURT:* I don't know. I see something faint there, /(Indicating)/.

*MS. CLARK:* Your Honor, the problem is really if you lay this over the
top of this, they don't match up and this printout is such a distortion
of what the original is, you have the original marked for evidence, why
in the world would you allow a distortion like that? It is kind of like
the People have a picture of a Defendant killing a victim and they took
it and blew it up as big as they could because it gets so fuzzy it was
indistinct. What is the value?

*THE COURT:* I assume on redirect examination you are going to go over
there and I assume when they are offered into evidence you will make a
352 objection.

*MR. HARMON:* We just didn't want to waste a lot of time.

*THE COURT:* Okay, okay.

/(Discussion held off the record.)/

/(Brief pause.)/

/(Pages 29044 through 29044, volume 152A, transcribed and sealed under
separate cover.)/

/(The following proceedings were held in open court:)/

//*THE COURT:* All right. Mr. Blasier.

*MR. BLASIER:* Your Honor, I would like to show 275-B on the elmo.

*THE COURT:* People's 275-B.

*MR. BLASIER:* Miss Montgomery, this is the gel that shows 30, 31, 293
and 305. Do you have that in mind?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* What AG number was that?

*MR. BLASIER:* 174.

*THE COURT:* What is the reference samples? 275-B is reference samples,
correct?

*MR. HARMON:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, do you see in the reference sample lane for Mr.
Simpson there appears to be three bands, would you agree?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I will refer to my copy.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. Can we zoom in on that a little bit more? Actually
there appears to be four bands, I think. Would you agree there appears
to be actually four bands in that reference lane?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. Those--that is a shadow band effect.

*MR. BLASIER:* That is not supposed to happen, is it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, sometimes you see it in this center section of
these acrylomite gels.

*MR. BLASIER:* That is not supposed to happen, is it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It is not supposed to happen? Umm, to optimize you
would prefer that it did not happen. It does happen on occasion, though.

*MR. BLASIER:* What do you mean to optimize you would prefer it not
happen? You don't want it to happen, do you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, you don't want it to happen.

*MR. BLASIER:* Something went wrong with this particular gel that caused
it to happen?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection, that is argumentative and she didn't complete
her answer.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* Did something go wrong with this particular gel that
caused these bands to show up?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, something didn't go wrong with the gel.
What--sometimes we see these--these shadow bands in the inside region of
the gel, just in the center section, and as you could see, it is
isolated to this center section of the gel. If, umm--if it was an issue,
the sample should be rerun. If there is a potential that these were
mixed samples or something such as that, then you would want to rerun
these. It doesn't change any of the results of the analysis on this gel.

*MR. BLASIER:* Isn't one of the shortcomings of this system is that that
sometimes happens, that you get extra bands on that that are shadow bands?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. That is argumentative, your Honor.

*THE COURT:* Sustained. Rephrase the question.

*MR. BLASIER:* Is that a characteristic of this system--let me ask you
this: How frequently does this happen?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It depends on who is doing the analysis. Different
people--this is a very techniquey system. Some individuals tend to see
it a little more often than others. In our laboratory we have been able
to minimize it, so we rarely see it any more.

*MR. BLASIER:* How often do you get it in tests that you conduct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I would say less than five percent of my gels would
see them.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, would you also agree that the band on Mr. Simpson's
reference sample at 24 is uneven in the sense that it is not even the
same intensity across the band?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(No audible response.)/

*MR. BLASIER:* It appears to be kind of very bright on the left side of
that band?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, there is the artifact, that little dot right on
the end of the 24 band, but by looking at this copy, this copy also has
that little dot, but it appears to be relatively equal intensity across
the length of the well.

*MR. BLASIER:* That little dot is not supposed to be there either, is it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* You are saying not supposed to be there. The dot is
not part of the sample, no.

*MR. BLASIER:* So it is not supposed to be there, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* One wouldn't want it to be there, no.

*MR. BLASIER:* Could we have photo no. 96 and I have an additional photo
that will be marking as 1178.

*THE COURT:* All right.

/(Deft's 1178 for id = photograph)/

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Could we have photo 1174 and 1178 side-by-side, please.

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Does the photograph on the right appear to be your run 299?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, it does not.

*MR. BLASIER:* What run does that appear to be?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* 24--294.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. And is it correct that these--the photo on the
right has the samples 303 and 304 from the Bronco on them?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(No audible response.)/

*MR. BLASIER:* I'm sorry, it is the one on the left.

*THE COURT:* The one on the left what?

*MR. BLASIER:* On the left of the screen is the--the run that has
samples 303 and 304?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And the one on the right is the run that has the samples
for 30 and 31 from the Bronco and 293 from the carpeting in the Bronco?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, 303 and 304, you read those as containing very weak
18 allele, I believe; is that correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Once again I will look up my notes.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. For the two Bronco samples, dna-52 and dna-53,
there was a weak 18 detected.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, I'm going to try and blow up that area, and the area
that we have indicated is approximately in here, /(Indicating)/; is that
correct?

*MR. HARMON:* Your Honor, I have the same objection that we lodged
earlier. That is a distortion.

*THE COURT:* Overruled.

*MR. BLASIER:* And here, /(Indicating)/?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(No audible response.)/

*MR. BLASIER:* Have I circled the right areas?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. As you could see, the 18 allele is--the 18 ladder
allele is--I'm sorry, yes, that is correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. And it is a very faint band, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, it is a weak band.

*MR. BLASIER:* Weak band. And it is a weak band on your original as
well, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, it is a weak band.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that would indicate a very small amount of DNA being
present, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, it is relative to the amount that is present in
the whole sample, yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. And were you able to quantify the amount of DNA
present that was contributed by the 18 allele?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No. What we do is a total quant to determine the total
amount of DNA. We can't tell the difference between different alleles,
contribution for the sample.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you agree that the band intensity of the 18 band
that I have circled is about the same as the one nanogram standard, or
maybe less, or just what is your assessment of the relative intensities?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I would say that is a--umm--

*THE COURT:* Pull the microphone closer.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm sorry. This is approximately equal to the one
nanogram, slightly less, umm, than the one nanogram for dna-53.

*MR. BLASIER:* And the intensity of that is far less than the 24 allele
and the 25 allele, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, yes, it is less than either the 24 or the 25
alleles.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, samples 30 and 31 are on the right picture, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, they are.

*MR. BLASIER:* And you did not see any 18 alleles on those samples, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* For item 30 and 31, no, I did not see an 18 allele.

*MR. BLASIER:* And I'm going to circle the area where you would expect
to see that. And would you agree that I have made little squiggles there
about where the 18 band would be?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, the upper portion of that, that's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. And you indicated there was nothing there that you
saw that could be a band?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* Could we have that printed, please.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, I want you to assume for a minute that 30 and 303
came from the same general area.

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. That is an improper hypothetical, misstates the
testimony.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* If you had a mixed stain that had alleles present in part
of the stain that weren't present in another part of the stain--do you
have that in mind?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* So what you are saying is a bloodstain where one
person is bleeding here and one person is bleeding here and some of one
person's diffuse into another?

*MR. BLASIER:* No. Let's just stay you have a stain, a fairly relatively
large stain, and you test one area of the stain and you find some
alleles and you test another area of the stain and you find some
additional alleles. Do you have that in mind?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would that be an indication--would one explanation be
that those stains were put there at different times?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection, calls for speculation.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. HARMON:* Inadequate foundation.

*THE COURT:* Sustained.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would that be consistent with two different stains being
put on that surface at different times?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I couldn't make a determination as to that, no.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. Could we have photo 90 back on.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, you have no personal information about what happened
between when sample 30 and 31 was collected and when sample 303 and 304
were collected, do you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I don't.

*MR. BLASIER:* Now, the appearance of the 18 allele on 303 and 304, the
very faint band, would you agree that the children of O.J. Simpson and
Nicole Brown Simpson both would have an 18 allele?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, that is incorrect.

*MR. BLASIER:* Why is it incorrect?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* You are saying they would or--

*MR. BLASIER:* They would have an 18 allele?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm sorry, you are correct. If the mother is an 18
homozygote, then the children will all have an 18 allele present.

*MR. BLASIER:* And there is a strong likelihood that those children
might also have a 24 or a 25?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And that is because you inherit these alleles from your
parents?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And if there were stains mixed in with a bloodstain
that--from the children, you might expect to see some of the children's
alleles in the stain, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* If you had individuals with the same type?

*MR. BLASIER:* Yes.

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, that is possible.

*MR. BLASIER:* And you have no way of telling whether the 18 allele in
samples 303 and 304 was put there or got into that sample at the same
time as the 24, 25 alleles, do you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I don't.

*MR. BLASIER:* You have no way of aging how old the sample is from
looking at the gel, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, some indication can be obtained by the--if a
yield gel is done on a sample. You can obtain some information if
degradation has occurred, but by looking at strictly the D1S80 results, no.

*MR. BLASIER:* But you might be able to tell if there is degradation but
you can't tell how old the stain is, can you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. BLASIER:* Could we have--I have two more photos, your Honor. One
would be 11--

*THE COURT:* 1179 and 1180.

/(Deft's 1179 for id = photograph)/

/(Deft's 1180 for id = photograph)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* 1179 and 1180. Could we have photo 97 and 98.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Now, the photograph on the left, would you agree that
that appears to be the gel with the samples from the glove, Bundy
glove--I'm sorry, the Rockingham glove, G11, 12 and 13?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes.

*MR. BLASIER:* And the one on the right, which is photograph--which is
exhibit 1180, appears to be stains G1, 2, 3, 4, 9 and 10, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, that's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And would you agree that you interpreted those--the three
stains, G10, 11 and 13, as having a weak 25 allele?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Once again I'm--I will refer to the report.

/(Brief pause.)/

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MS. MONTGOMERY:* It is a weaker 25 allele; it is not a weak 25 allele.

*MR. BLASIER:* It is much less intensity than the other alleles on those
lanes, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. It is less intense than the 24 allele.

*MR. BLASIER:* And let me circle 11 and 13. Have I got those about right?

*THE COURT:* Why don't you do the second one again. Encroach on the band
itself.

*MR. BLASIER:* Let me circle both of them.

*MR. BLASIER:* Okay. And the 25 band is here, /(Indicating)/, and here,
/(Indicating)/, for those two samples, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And the fact that it is so much less intense than the 24
band would indicate that if there was a contribution from a 24, 25
genotype, that that person's contribution is very, very small compared
to other contributors?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. The 24, 25 or--if--the 25 is--well, the 25 is the
minor component along with an 18 on those samples and the 24, 24 is the
major contribution, so the minor contribution would be less than the
major contribution.

*MR. BLASIER:* And the same is true over on the picture at the right of
G10 with respect to the 25 allele, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct, but in that situation there isn't an
18 allele present.

*MR. BLASIER:* But you call it a 25 that is much less intense than a 24,
correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I called a major type and a minor type--a major type
and a minor allele in that particular sample.

*MR. BLASIER:* Can we print that, please. Save it and print it later.
And could I have slide--first slide.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* The three stains from the glove, G10, 11 and 13, were
the only stains on the glove where you found genotypes in the D1S80
system consistent with Mr. Simpson, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct. Those are the only--those are the
three areas where a 25 allele was detected along with the 24 allele.

*MR. BLASIER:* And this is 1173-A. Could we have B, please.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* And the indication that you have on your paperwork is
that those three stains all came from the wrist area of the Rockingham
glove, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That's correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And--may we have the next slide, please.

*MR. BLASIER:* You tested a number of different stains from the rest of
the Bundy glove--the Rockingham glove, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Correct.

*MR. BLASIER:* And isn't it accurate that you were able to exclude Mr.
Simpson as a contributor to every stain that you looked at on that
glove, other than G10, 11 and 13 in the wrist area?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. There was no 25 allele detected on the other stains.

*MR. BLASIER:* And there was--when you received this glove, do you know
whether it was turned inside out?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I--Gary Sims did all the examination of the evidence
in this case, so I don't recall.

*MR. BLASIER:* As a forensic specialist, if you got a glove as a piece
of evidence and you wanted to turn it inside out, how do you do that?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* /(No audible response.)/

*MR. BLASIER:* Do you have to handle the wrist area a lot to get it
turned inside out?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Well, I think it is not just a forensic analyst, but
how would an individual in general turn a glove inside out if it were
out the opposite direction.

*MR. BLASIER:* Would you agree it would involve considerable
manipulation of the wrist area of the glove?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I would.

*MR. HARMON:* Objection. That calls for speculation, your Honor.

*/THE COURT:/*/Sustained. It is vague. (Discussion held off the record
between Defense counsel.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Your Honor, this would be an appropriate time to break.

*THE COURT:* Finish.

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* Do you have any way of quantifying the amount of DNA
attributable to the 25 allele in G10, 11 and 13?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No.

*MR. BLASIER:* Do you have any way of placing an upper limit on it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes, I could, umm, by looking at the relative
intensity of the 25 compared to the major contributor of a 24
homozygote, I could tell you the extremes that it could be and for the
sensitivity of our system what we find is beyond 1 to 20, you can't see
the minor components--you typically cannot see the minor contribution in
a sample.

*MR. BLASIER:* But you have no way of quantifying how much DNA was
present that caused the 25 allele to appear?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* The exact amount? No.

*MR. BLASIER:* It could be a very small amount?

*MR. HARMON:* Objection, that calls for speculation.

*THE COURT:* It is vague. Sustained

/(Discussion held off the record between Defense counsel.)/

//*MR. BLASIER:* It could be below one nanogram, couldn't it?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* The total DNA or of DNA on the--

*MR. BLASIER:* DNA on the gel?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* On the gel. Well, in this case what I could do is
compare the one nanogram standard, the 25 allele to the one nanogram
standard, and would you like me to do that?

*MR. BLASIER:* Yes.

/(Brief pause.)/

//*MS. MONTGOMERY:* That 25 allele is approximately equal intensity to
the one nanogram control that is on the gel.

*MR. BLASIER:* I'm sorry, which sample were you looking at?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* I'm looking at G11 and also G13.

*MR. BLASIER:* How about G10?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* G10 is also approximately equal to the one nanogram
standard.

*MR. BLASIER:* It is a much smaller amount compared to the other alleles
on the gels, correct?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* Yes. The other--the other band in those samples looks
a little greater than the four nanogram standard.

*MR. BLASIER:* You have no way of telling from this test whether or not
that 25 allele got on that glove at the same time as the other alleles
on the glove, do you?

*MS. MONTGOMERY:* No, I don't.

*MR. BLASIER:* That's all I have.

*THE COURT:* All right. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to
take our recess for the afternoon. Please remember all of my admonitions
to you. Don't discuss this case among yourselves, don't form any
opinions about the case, don't allow anybody to communicate with you,
don't conduct any deliberations until the matter has been submitted to
you. As far as the jury is concerned, we will stand in recess until 9:00
A.M. tomorrow morning. And Miss Montgomery, you are ordered to come back
tomorrow morning at 8:45. All right. We will stand in recess. Thank you,
counsel.
